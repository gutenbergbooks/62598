<div class="preface">
<p>I wish this little book to be in every respect
as unpretending as possible. I do not presume
to represent myself as an original investigator,
nor do I aspire to a greater distinction than
that of representing clearly and intelligently
the views of those distinguished writers who
have made the study of philology the chief
pursuit of their lives.</p>

<p>While I have quoted my authorities for
almost every statement of importance, I have
generally used my own language, and even in
those paragraphs which I have put between
inverted commas I have so frequently abbreviated,
expanded, or transposed, that the passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
must not be criticised as though they
had been intended for direct translations.</p>

<p>I do not think that I have ever borrowed from
any writer, English, French, or German, without
ample acknowledgment. I would not be so
dishonest as to shine in borrowed plumes. If
in one or two cases I have been guilty of
apparent plagiarism it is certainly only from
the works of those authors whom I cannot be
considered to have robbed wilfully, because
their writings are honourably referred to on
almost every page. I wish this remark to
apply especially to the very clear, learned, and
beautiful treatises of M. Ernest Renan, to which
I am largely indebted, and without which I
should not have undertaken this work.</p>

<p>The questions here handled have always been
to me full of interest; and these chapters have
been chiefly written because I have invariably
found that they are also full of interest to young
learners. Should it be proved that I have rashly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
intruded on a task beyond my powers, no one
will more regret this attempt than I shall
myself.</p>

<p>The books of which I have made <em>chief</em> use
in the following pages are</p>

<p>Of all the faculties wherewith God has endowed
his noblest creature, none is more divine and
mysterious than the faculty of speech. It is the
gift whereby man is raised above the beasts; the
gift whereby soul speaks to soul; the gift whereby
mere pulses of articulated air become breathing
thoughts and burning words; the gift whereby
we understand the affections of men and give
expression to the worship of God; the gift whereby
the lip of divine<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> inspiration uttering things
simple and unperfumed and unadorned, reacheth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
with its passionate voice through a thousand generations
by the help of God.</p>

<p>Language is the sum total of those articulate
sounds which man, by the aid of this marvellous
faculty of speech, has produced and accepted as the
signs of all those inward and outward phenomena
wherewith he is made acquainted by sense and
thought. These signs are “those<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> shadows of
the soul, those living sounds which we call words!
and compared with them how poor are all other
monuments of human power, or perseverance, or
skill, or genius! They render the mere clown an
artist, nations immortal, writers, poets, philosophers
divine!” Let him who would rightly understand
the grandeur and dignity of speech,
meditate on the deep mystery involved in the
revelation of the Lord Jesus as the Word of God.</p>

<p>No study is more rich in grand results than the
study of language, and to no study can we look
with greater certainty to elucidate the earliest
history of mankind. For the roots of language<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
spring in the primitive liberty of human intelligence,
and therefore its records bear on them the
traces of human history. We read with deep
interest the works of individual genius, and trace
in them the life and character of the men on
whom it has been bestowed; we toilfully examine
the unburied monuments of extinct nations, and
are rewarded for years of labour if we can finally
succeed in gaining a feeble glimpse of their history
by deciphering the unknown letters carved on the
crumbling fragments of half-calcined stone; but
in language we have the history not only of individuals
but of nations; not only of nations but of
mankind. For unlike music and poetry, which
are the special privilege of the few, language<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is
the property of all, as necessary and accessible as
the air we breathe. Of all that men have invented
and combined; of all that they have produced or
interchanged among themselves; of all that they
have drawn from their peculiar organism, language
is the noblest and most indispensible treasure.
An immediate emanation of human nature,
and progressing with it, language is the common
blessing, the common patrimony, of mankind. It
is an<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> admirable poem on the history of all ages;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
a living monument, on which is written the
genesis of human thought. Thus “the ground<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
on which our civilisation stands is a sacred one,
for it is the deposit of thought. For language,
as it is the mirror, so is it the product of reason,
and as it embodies thought, so is it the child of
thought. In it are deposited the primordial
sparks of that celestial fire, which, from a once
bright centre of civilisation, has streamed forth
over the inhabited earth, and which now already,
after less than three myriads of years, forms a
galaxy round the globe, a chain of light from pole
to pole.”</p>

<p>Philology, the science which devotes itself to
the study of language, has recently<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> arrived at
results almost undreamed of by preceding centuries.
Indeed, it received its most vigorous impulse
from the acquaintance with the languages
of India, and, above all, with Sanskrit, which,
like so many other great blessings, directly resulted
from our dominion in India. Already it
has thrown new light on many of the most perplexing
problems of religion, history, and ethnography;
and, being yet but an infant science, it
is in all probability destined to achieve triumphs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of which at present we can but dimly prophesy
the consequences.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Since the most ancient monuments of Sanskrit,
Zend,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Hebrew, and in fact of all languages, are
separated, perhaps by thousands of years from<a name="FNanchor_9a" id="FNanchor_9a"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
the appearance of language (<em>i.e.</em>, from the creation
of the human race), it might seem impossible to
throw any light on that most interesting of all
considerations, the <em>origin</em> of language. And yet
so permanent are the creations of speech, so invariable
and ascertainable are the laws of its
mutation, that the geologist is less clearly able
to describe the convulsions of the earth’s strata
than the philologist to point out, by the indications
of language, the undoubted traces of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
nation’s previous life. On the stone tablets of
the universe, God’s own finger has written the
changes which millions of years have wrought on
the mountain and the plain; in the fluid air,
which he articulates into human utterance, man
has preserved for ever the main facts of his past
history, and the main processes of his inmost
soul. The sonorous wave, indeed, which transmits
to our ears the uttered thought, reaches but a
little distance, and then vanishes like the tremulous
ripple on the surface of the sea; but, conscious
of his destiny, man invented writing to
give it perpetuity from age to age. Its short
reach, its brief continuance, are the defects of the
spoken word, but when graven on the stone or
painted on the vellum it passes from one end of
the earth to the other for all time; it conquers at
once eternity and space.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>From the earliest ages the origin of language
has been a topic of discussion and speculation,
and a vast number of treatises have been written
upon it. But it is only in modern times that we
have collected sufficient data to admit of any
consistent or exhaustive theory, and the earlier<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
writers contented themselves for the most part
with building systems before they had collected
facts.</p>

<p>There have been three main theories to account
for the appearance of language, and it will be both
interesting and instructive to pass them in brief
review. They are:&mdash;1. That language was innate
and organic. 2. That language was the result
partly of imitation, and partly of convention.
3. That language was revealed. It will be seen
from our consideration of them, that none of
these theories is in itself wholly true or adequate,
yet that each of them has a partial value, and
that they are not <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'so irreconcileably'">so irreconcilably</ins> opposed to
each other as might at first sight be imagined.</p>

<p>1. It was believed by the ancients generally,
and perhaps by the majority of moderns, that
language was <em>innate and organic</em>; <em>i.e.</em>, a distinct
<em>creation</em> synchronising with the creation of man.
The inferences drawn from this supposition led
men to regard words as “types of objective
reality, the shadow of the body and the image
reflected in the mirror.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The words were supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to be not only a sign of the thing intended
by them, but in some way to partake of its nature,
and to express and symbolise something of its
idea. Hence the very notion of arbitrariness was
well-nigh expelled from language, and there was
supposed to be a deep harmony<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> between the
physiological quality of the sound and its significance&mdash;between
the combination and connection
of sounds with the connection and combined
relations of the things they represented. Whoever,
therefore, knew the names, knew also the
things which the names implied.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> However<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
strange and even ridiculous these views may
appear to our somewhat superficial and unphilosophical
age, it is far more difficult to understand
them truly than to speak of them contemptuously,
and they led to a reverence for the use of speech
which reacted beneficially in producing careful
writing and accurate thought.</p>

<p>The belief that language was innate led to the
strange hallucination that if a child were entirely
secluded from human contact, he would speak
instinctively the primitive language of mankind.
According to Herodotus, the experiment was
actually made by Psammetichus, King of Egypt,
who entrusted two new-born infants to a shepherd,
with the injunction to let them suck a goat’s
milk, and to speak no words in their presence, but
to observe what word they would first utter. After
two years the shepherd visited them, and they
approached him, stretching<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> out their hands, and
uttering the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βεκός</span>. It was found that this
vocable existed in the Phrygian language, and
meant “bread;” whence it was sagely inferred
that the Phrygians spoke the original language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and were the most ancient of people. There is
in this story such a delicious naïveté, that one
could hardly expect that it would have happened
in any except very early ages. It can, however,
be paralleled by the popular opinion which attributed
the same experiment to James IV. and
Frederic II.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in the Middle Ages. In the latter
case the little unfortunates died for want of
lullabies! Similarly, almost every nation has regarded
its own language as the primitive one.
One of the historians of St. Louis says that a deaf
mute, miraculously healed at the king’s tomb,
spoke, not in the language of Burgundy, where
he was born, but in the language<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> of the capital.
A similar belief seems to underlie the extreme
anxiety and curiosity of savages to learn the name
of any article hitherto unknown to them, as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the name had some absolute significance. This
is not the place to enter into a discussion of that
deep germ of truth which such fancies involve;
but hints of it may be found in Holy<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Scripture.</p>

<p>No doubt at first sight it appears that much
might be said in favour of the innate and organic
nature of language. Its beauty,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> its diversity, its
power, its diffusion over the whole surface of the
globe, give it the supernatural air of a gift which
man, so far from originating, can only ruin and
destroy. We see that in favourable situations
language, like vegetation, flourishes and blossoms,
while elsewhere it fades and dies away as
a plant loses its foliage when deprived of nourishment
and light. It seems, too, to participate in
that healing power of nature, which effaces rapidly
all trace of wounds received. Like nature, it
produces mighty results out of feeble resources&mdash;it
is economical without avarice, and liberal without
prodigality.</p>

<p>Again; do we not see that almost every living
thing is endowed in infinite variety with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
faculty of uttering sounds, and even of intercommunicating
feelings?<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The air is thrilled
with the voice of birds, and some of them even
possess a power of articulation, which among
many nations is the distinctive<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> definition of
man. Nay, fancy has attributed to animals a
power of language in the age of gold&mdash;a power
which under certain<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> circumstances they are
supposed to be still allowed to exercise.</p>

<p>But this leads us to the true point of difference.
The dog barks, as it barked<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> at the creation, and
the crow of the cock is the same now as when it
reached the ear of repentant Peter. The song of
the nightingale, and the howl of the leopard, have
continued as unchangeable as the concentric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
circles of the spider, and the waxen hexagon of
the bee. The one as much as the other are the
result of a blind though often perfect instinct.
They are unalterable because they are innate,
and the utterances of mankind would have been
as unchangeable as those of animals, had they
been in the same way the result not of liberty
but of necessity. To the cries of animals we
must compare, not man’s ever-varying language,
but those instinctive sounds of weeping, sobbing,
moaning&mdash;the changeless scream, sigh, or laughter&mdash;by
which, since the creation, he has given relief
or expression to his physical<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> sensations.</p>

<p>In point of fact&mdash;as a thousand experiments
might have proved to Psammetichus&mdash;a new-born
infant possesses the faculty of language, not
actually, but only potentially. It is obvious that
an Italian infant, picked up on the field of Solferino
and carried to Paris, would not have spokenδυναμις
Italian but French, and an English babe, carried
off by the Caffirs, would find no difficulty in
learning the rich language of Caffraria, with its
five-and-twenty moods. For language is clearly
learned by <em>imitation</em>. This is the intermediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
link between the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δύναμις</span> and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔργον</span>. When
poor Kaspar Hauser tottered into the streets <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of Nüremburg'">of
Nuremberg</ins>, the only words he could say were,
“I will be a soldier as my father was,” because
those were the only words which he had heard
in his miserable confinement. Doubtless, the
Egyptian children pronounced the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βεκός</span>,
because it approached as nearly as possible to
the bleating<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> of the goat by which they had been
suckled.</p>

<p>Had there ever been an innate organic language,
it is quite certain that it must have left
some traces; for, as Dr. Latham observes, “language
(as an instrument of criticism in ethnology)
is <em>the most permanent</em> of the criteria of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
relationships derivable from our moral constitution.”
Talleyrand’s wicked witticism, that “language
was given us to conceal our thoughts,”
arose from the fact that it is used for that purpose
on a thousand occasions. But although a
man may “coin his face into smiles,” and utter a
thousand honeyed words, his real sentiments <em>will</em>
flash out sometimes in passionate gesture and
rapid glance; and just in the same way, had there
even been a language which was the organic
expression of emotion, it is absolutely impossible
that it should have wholly disappeared. That
which is really implanted is for the most part
unalterable.</p>

<p>2. Seeing, then, that positive experiment, as
well as other considerations, disprove the inneity
of language, other philosophers believed that it
was simply conventional, and grew up gradually
after a period of mutism. The Epicurean philosophy,
deeply tainted with the error of man’s
slow and toilsome development from a savage and
almost bestial<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> condition, gave the problem the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
hardest of all material solutions. This school
found in Lucretius its most splendid exponent,
and the poet accounts for the appearance of
speech as the gradual and instinctive endeavour
to supply a want.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In short, words came because
they were required, much in the same way that,
according to the theory of Lamarck, organic
peculiarities are the result of habit and instinct,
so that the crane acquired a long neck and long
legs by persevering attempts to fish. Lucretius
compares language to the widely diverse sounds
which animals emit to express different sensations,
and, scornfully rejecting the theory of one Name-giver,
asserts repeatedly that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse0">“Utilitas<a name="FNanchor_27a" id="FNanchor_27a"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> expressit nomina rerum.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>It was generally believed by this school that
man originally acquired the faculty of speech by
an observation of the sounds of nature. The
cries of animals, “the hollow murmuring wind
and silver rain,” the sighing of the woods,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“The tongue of forests green and flowery wilds,”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">these, it seems, were man’s<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> teachers in the power
of articulation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">&nbsp; “The joyous birds shrouded in cheerful shade,</p>
<p class="verse4">Their notes unto the voice attempted sweet;</p>
<p class="verse2">Th’ angelical soft trembling voices made</p>
<p class="verse4">To th’ instruments divine respondence meet,</p>
<p class="verse2">With the base murmurs of the water’s fall;</p>
<p class="verse4">The water’s fall with difference discreet,</p>
<p class="verse2">Now soft, now loud, unto the wind did call;</p>
<p class="verse0">The gentle warbling wind low answerëd to all.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Man, too, would endeavour to take his part in
the divine harmony; he would translate into
living and intelligent utterances the dim and
sublime music of this unconscious hymn.</p>

<p>Like most theories that have met with any
amount of acceptance, this belief contains a germ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of truth. It originated from the onomatopœic
character of a large part of all languages.
But we reject the conclusion drawn from this
fact. That man produced a large or very large
part of his vocabulary by an imitation of natural
sounds is entirely true, but that the idea of
speech was created in him by the hearing of
those sounds we believe to be eminently false.
This theory, however, found especial favour
among the philosophers of the eighteenth century,
except that with them a mysterious convention
seemed not even to require this natural
basis. Maupertuis, Condillac, Rousseau, Volney,
Nodier, Herder, Monboddo, and Dr. Smith,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> all
seem to believe in an original time when a few
intonations, joined to gesture and expression of
the face, sufficed for the wants of nascent
humanity, and formed, in fact, a natural language;
but in course of time this was found inadequate,
and so “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on convint,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> on s’arrangea à l’aimable,
et ainsi fut établi le <em>langage artificiel</em> ou articulé</span>.”
According to Monboddo the steps of the process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
were briefly as follows:&mdash;1, Inarticulate cries;
2, Gestures; 3, Imitative sounds; 4, An artificial
language, formed by convention, and resulting
from the necessities of the race. This language
was originally poor and defective, but developed
into richness, just as (to quote the simile of Adelung)
the canoe of the savage has grown into the
floating city of modern nations. All other conjectures
are, however, eclipsed by Dr. Murray’s
derivation of all the languages of Europe from
nine onomatopœic syllables. These wondrous
vocables<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> were:&mdash;1, Ag; 2, Bag; 3, Dwag;
4, Cwag; 5, Lag; 6, Mag; 7, Nag; 8, Rag;
9, Swag!!! M. Renan (who believes that <em>all</em> the
parts of speech existed implicitly in the primitive
language) may well remark that of all theories
this is “the most false, or rather the least rich in
truth;” and it may be known by its fruits, for the
natural inference from it is either “that<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
is merely an affection of perishable matter (<em>materialism</em>),
or that both are indiscriminately accidents
of the one divine substance of the universe
(<em>pantheism</em>).” It is true that language, though
not the result of convention, tends to <em>become</em><a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
conventional in the process of time, but this very
tendency is often a mark of decay and ruin, and
a language is a noble and powerful instrument of
thought in proportion as it keeps in view the
motives and principles which originated the words
of which it is composed.</p>

<p>3. The third main theory, which has found
numberless supporters, is, that <em>language is due to
direct revelation</em>. The tenacity of this belief was
mainly due to the violent reaction of the spiritualist
school in the nineteenth century against
the systematising scepticism of their predecessors.
It was warmly adopted by MM. de Bonald, de
Maistre, De Lammenais, and others, and was in
one sense a step forwards, for it recognised at
least that “divine<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> spark which glows in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
idioms even the most imperfect and uncultivated.”
But this theory must likewise be rejected. It
raises<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> men to the level of gods, as much as the
former theory had degraded them to the rank of
beasts. “Spiritualism contradicts nature, as
materialism contradicts mind. It has reality and
history against it as much as its opposite.”</p>

<p>This view opens considerations of such importance
that we must subject it to a still more
careful discussion.</p>

<p>We object, in the first place, to the difficulty
and obscurity of the phrase. In one sense,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
indeed&mdash;if we take it metaphorically,&mdash;it is
perhaps the most exact expression to describe
the wonderful apparition of human speech, which
it rightly withdraws from the sphere of vulgar
inventions. Language, as an immediate product of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
human powers, might perhaps, with more safety,
be attributed to the Universal Cause, than to the
particular action of human liberty. If by revelation
be intended <em>the spontaneous play of the
human faculties</em>, in this sense, God, having endowed
man with all things requisite for the discovery
of language, may, with near approximation
to truth, be called its Author; but then, why
make use of an expression so indirect and liable
to be misunderstood, when others more natural
and more philosophical might have been found
to indicate the same<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> fact?</p>

<p>But, unhappily, M. de Bonald and others who
urged this view took the expression literally, and
made it not scientific but theological; not a disinterested<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and independent conclusion drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from induction, but a mere dogma of faith to be
forced (like so many other false excrescences of
theological tradition) upon the conscience of all
Christians. In general, those who maintain the
literal revelation of language, and reject its
human origin, are the direct successors of those
theologians who have so long opposed every discovery
in science, and rejected the plainest deductions
of geometry and logic. They intrude
into a sphere in which they have no knowledge
and no place; their arguments are neither
scientific nor reasonable; they are not reasons
but assertions; not conclusions but idle and
groundless prejudices. It has been well said
that they pertain to an order of ideas and interests
which science repudiates, and with which
she has nothing to do. Ignorance has no claim
to a hearing even when she speaks <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i>.</p>

<p>Now what is meant by such an expression as
the revelation of language rigorously understood?
If, for instance, we take it materially, if we
understand it to mean that a voice from heaven
dictated to men the names of things&mdash;such a
conception is so grossly<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> anthropomorphic, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
so utterly at variance with all scientific explanation,
it is so irreconcileably opposed to all our
ideas of the laws of nature, that it needs no
refutation for one who is in the least degree
initiated into the methods of modern criticism.
Besides, as M. Cousin<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> has remarked, “it only
removes the difficulty a step backwards without
resolving it. For signs divinely invented would
for us not be <em>signs</em> but <em>things</em>, which we should
have been subsequently obliged to elevate into
signs by attaching to them certain significations.”
The revealed “term” would be a useless encumbrance
unless it corresponded with some well
understood conception; and therefore if words
were revealed, conceptions must also have been
implanted; and we are thus driven to the
absurdity of supposing that anterior to all experience,
we knew that which experience (<em>i.e.</em> an<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
actual relation of intelligence with that which is
the object of intelligence) alone could teach us.</p>

<p>We have already said that these modern
spiritualists considered the revelation of language
to be a truth involved by the narrative of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Genesis. In this they were the slaves of a false
and narrow exegesis, which had not even the
poor excuse of being literal. What is the true
meaning of the sacred writer we shall endeavour
to show further on; but we cannot here abstain
from again uttering a strong protest against the
barrier placed in the way of all honest scientific
inquiry by the timid prejudices of that class which
tyrannises over public opinion. When shall we
learn to acquiesce practically in the belief which
theoretically the most orthodox have long expressed,
that it is a needless incongruity to look
in the Bible for scientific truths which it does
not profess to reveal? “Such<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> an attempt,” it
has been well said, “has been <em>a perversion of
the purpose of a divine revelation, and cannot
lead to any physical truth</em>.”</p>

<p>Honesty all the more imperiously demands
this remark, because here, as in a thousand other
places, perverted by system and ignorance, we
believe that the Bible rightly understood contains
(not precise dogmas, but) the general indications
of a sublime truth; and because it may be shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that in this particular instance <em>its records accurately
agree with the results of careful and
laborious inquiry</em>. Here, as often, the Bible
does not clash with the conclusions of science,
if taken <em>to imply no more than what it categorically
asserts</em>. But the Bible is not the <em>only</em>
source of information open to us, and if we are
ever in any way to fill up “the vast lacunas
which characterise that gigantic and mysterious
epitaph of humanity engraved in the first chapters
of Genesis,” we must do so not by ignorant
and dogmatic assertions, but by humble sincerity
and patient research.</p>

<p>If, then, language were revealed, the Bible is
not only silent on such a revelation, but distinctly
implies the reverse. We shall examine
the narrative of Genesis (ii. 19, 20) farther on;
but we must here stop to observe that where the
Deity is represented as talking to Adam and
other patriarchs, such passages must not be supposed
to have any bearing on the question, as it
is quite clear that they are only intended for an
expressive anthropomorphism.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Even Luther,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in his Commentary on Genesis, goes out of his
way to prove that nothing material is intended
in such phrases as God’s “speaking to” Adam,
and that it would be as strange to suppose that
they imply any<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> revelation of language, as it
would be to infer the revelation of writing from
the mention of the stone tables “written by the
finger of God.” Writing also has been attributed
directly to God’s external gift, although, as in
the case of language, there is the clearest proof
of its human origin and gradual perfectionment.</p>

<p>But we must not omit one or two positive
arguments against this theory.</p>

<p>1. Had language been revealed, mankind at
first would have been better situated than any of
their posterity; and such a disposition is unlike
the ordinary course of God’s just dealings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>2. So far from being “a pale image and feeble
echo of splendours which have passed away from
the scene of earth,” each human language bears
in itself the most distinct traces of growth and
progress&mdash;the marks of a regular development
in accordance with definite laws&mdash;the successive
traces of infancy, youth, maturity, and manhood.
Though many existing languages, and even those
of some savage nations are but “degraded and
decaying fragments of nobler formations,” yet
there are proofs as decisive that they rose to
gradual perfection, as that they subsequently fell
from perfection to decay.</p>

<p>3. If the spiritualist theory were true, it would
be a most natural inference that the spiritual
and abstract signification of roots is also the
original one. But such an assumption (although
it is made by Frederic Schlegel), “is contradicted
by the history of every language of the
world.”</p>

<p>4. It is equally improbable that God who
revealed the primitive language, or man who
received it, should have suffered it (divine, as on
this supposition it must have been) to degenerate
into barbarous and feeble jargons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>5. “The human faculties <em>are competent</em> to the
formation of<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>language.” It is therefore totally
unlike God’s methods, as observed in His works,
to give <em>directly</em> what can be evolved <em>mediately</em>.
For there is clearly no waste in the economy of
Nature, no prodigality in the display of miracles.
In the words of Grimm, “it seems contrary to
the wisdom of God to impose the restraint of a
created form on that which was destined to a
free historic development.” At any rate, as a
fact we <em>can</em> historically trace the development of
language from a very small nucleus, and this
being the case the supposition of any previous
revealed language is a groundless and improbable
hypothesis.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Further arguments will appear as we proceed;
but we must now point out the true meaning of
the statement in Genesis, that “God brought all
living creatures to Adam <em>to see what he would
call them</em>; and whatsoever Adam called every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
living creature that was the name thereof.”<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Now, merely remarking (by way of limitation)
that the writer clearly supposed his own language
to be that of Paradise, and that there is here no
attempt to account for all<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> language, because he
is speaking of a certain class of words only&mdash;we
find in this narrative a profound verity clothed in
a most beautiful and appropriate symbol: ‘We
see man as the true nomenclator&mdash;man acting by
his own peculiar faculties under the guide of the
Deity. Philosophy<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> could find no more perfect
figure to express her conclusions than this&mdash;God
teaching man to speak as a father would a son.’
But to give this simple narrative a material
explanation is to falsify at once both its letter
and its spirit. On the other hand, “to say with
the theologians that God had created language<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as he had created man, and that language is not
the act and work of man,” is to contradict not
only reason but the Bible too. For be it observed,
that the Bible distinctly confirms our
arguments by saying, not that <em>God</em> named the
animals, but that <em>Adam</em> named them, and that
whatsoever <em>he</em> named every living creature <em>that</em>
was the name thereof.</p>

<p>In short, language is “only divine in proportion
to the divinity of our nature and our soul;”
it is only a gift of God because the faculty
naturally resulted from the physical and spiritual
organism which God had created. This seems a
more natural and philosophic supposition than
the belief that even the <em>embryonic germ</em> of language
was revealed. The exercise of the faculty
in the original utterance of primitive words has
ceased to be called into play because it has
ceased to be required. We cannot now invent
original words because there is no longer any
necessity for doing so. In the same way&mdash;as is
well known&mdash;a deaf mute when once instructed
in an artificial language loses the quick instinctive
power of creating intelligible natural signs.</p>

<p>We conclude, then, that language is neither
innate and organic; nor a mechanical invention;
nor an external gift of revelation;&mdash;but a natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
faculty swiftly developed by a powerful instinct,
the result of intelligence<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and human freedom
which have no place in purely organic<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> functions.
It was “the living product of the whole<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> inner
man.” It was “not<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> a gift bestowed ready
formed to man, but something coming from himself.”
It is “essentially<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> human; it owes to our
full liberty both its origin and its progress; it is
our history, our heritage.” Objectively considered,
it was the result of organism: subjectively,
the product of intelligence. It was “a
primitive intuition, impersonal and yet influenced
by individual genius;” in a word, its character
is “at once<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> objective and subjective, at once
individual and general, at once free and necessary,
at once human and divine.”</p>

<p>That such a conclusion,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> however much it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
seem to savour of a weak eclecticism by combining
all former theories, is yet in profound accordance
with all the ascertained facts of language
we shall hope to prove in the following chapter.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEA
OF SPEECH.</span></h2>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Speech is morning to the mind;</p>
<p class="verse0">It spreads the beauteous images abroad,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which else lie dark and buried in the soul.”</p>
</div></div>


<p>From abstract and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> considerations, we
have arrived at the conclusion that language was
achieved or created by the human race, by the
unconscious or spontaneous exercise of divinely
implanted powers; that it was a faculty analogous
to and closely implicated with that of
thought, and, like thought, developing itself
with<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the aid of time. The idea of speech was
innate, and the evolution of that idea may be
traced in the growth and history of language.
It is most important to have a clear conception
of the fact that this development did not result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
from an atomistic<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> reunion of parts, but from
the vitality derived from an inward principle.
Language was formed by a process not of crystalline
accretion but of germinal development.
Every essential part of language existed as completely
(although only implicitly) in the primitive
germ, as the petals of a flower exist in the bud
before the mingled influences of the sun and the
air have caused it to unfold.</p>

<p>Our belief thus arrived at&mdash;viz., that language
was an achievement of the human genius which
God implanted in the primeval man, a development
of the faculty with which he endowed our
race&mdash;does not at all necessitate the belief in a
period when man was unable to communicate
with man. The exercise of the faculty may have
been rapid in that young and noble nature to a
degree which now we cannot even conceive. A
few imitative roots, uttered under the guidance
of a divine instinct, and aided by the play of
intelligence in movement and feature, would with
wonderful ease grow into a language sufficient
for the needs of a nascent humanity, and the
living germ would soon bud and bourgeon by
the very law of its production. Even if we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
compelled to believe that this language was at
first of the scantiest character, we see in this
supposition nothing more absurd than in the
certainty that knowledge and science, philosophy
and art, are the slow, gradual, and toilsome conquests
of an ever progressive race. It is now
well understood that even the use of the senses
has to be learnt,&mdash;that it is only by practice that
we are able to discriminate distances in the
variously-coloured surface which is all that we
really see. Why should it then be unnatural to
suppose that speech also was at first only implicitly
bestowed on us, and that it required time
and experience to develop fully the implanted
capacity?</p>

<p>How far the growth of language was affected
by external circumstances,&mdash;as, for instance, by
the impress of individual minds, by the aristocracy
or even autocracy of philosophic bodies, by
the influence of sex, by the variations of climate,
by the convulsions of history, by the slow change
of religious or political convictions, and even by
the laws of euphony and organisation, we may
consider hereafter; but we must first of all enter
on two very interesting preliminary inquiries, viz.,
1, How did words first come to be accepted as
signs at all? and, 2, By what processes did men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hit upon the words themselves? Or, to put the
questions differently: 1, How did various modulations
of the human voice acquire any significance
by being connected with outward or inward
phenomena? and, 2, What special causes led in
special cases to the choice of some particular
modulations rather than of any other?</p>

<p>I am well aware that these questions may
appear ridiculous to any one who is entirely
unaccustomed to these branches of inquiry; and
they may possibly be inclined to set the whole
matter at rest by a dogmatism or a jeer. They
will say perhaps:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Here babbling Insight shouts in Nature’s ears</p>
<p class="verse0">His last conundrum of the orbs and spheres;</p>
<p class="verse0">There Self-inspection sucks his little thumb,</p>
<p class="verse0">With ‘Whence am I?’ and ‘Wherefore did I come?’”<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">With readers of such a temperament it is idle to
reason, nor do we expect that, while the world
lasts, ignorance will cease to take itself for knowledge,
and denounce what it cannot understand.
To others we will merely say that these inquiries
have occupied, and are still occupying in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
increasing degree, some of the most profound and
sober intellects in Europe, and that (in the words
of Plato) ‘wise men do not usually talk nonsense.’</p>

<p>With this remark, let us proceed to our first
question: How came sounds&mdash;mere vibrations of
the atmosphere&mdash;to be accepted as signs, <em>i.e.</em> to
be used as words?</p>

<p>But (as one inquiry leads us back, perpetually,
to another, even until “all things end in a
mystery”), we must here again pause for a
moment to ask what <em>is</em> a word? So vast an
amount has been written in answer to this
inquiry, that it is obviously impossible to do
more than state the conclusion<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> we adopt, with a
mere hint as to the ground on which we adopt it.</p>

<p>Horne Tooke maintained that words are “the
names of things,” a definition most obviously inadequate;
others have called them “the pictures
of ideas,”<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and although this definition is not
without its value, yet the systematic perversion of
the word “idea,” renders it insufficient. Harris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
devotes a chapter to establishing the definition
that “Words are the symbols of ideas, both
general and particular; yet, of the general,
primarily, essentially, and immediately; of the
particular only secondly, accidentally, and mediately.”
But this is very questionable and
cumbrous; and, on the whole, we believe that no
better definition can be given than that of the
late Mr. Garnett,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> that words represent “<em>conceptions</em>
founded on <em>perceptions</em>,” or “that words
express the <em>relations</em> of things.” They do not
and cannot express “an intrinsic meaning, constituting
them the counterparts and equivalents
of thought. They <em>are</em> nothing more, and <em>can</em> be
nothing more, than signs of relations, and it is a
contradiction in terms to affirm that a relation
can be inherent.” “Our knowledge of beings,”
says M. Peisse,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> “is purely indirect, limited, relative;
it does not reach to the beings themselves
in their absolute reality and essences, but only to
their accidents, their modes, their relations, their
limitations, their differences, their qualities; all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which are manners of conceiving and knowing,
which not only do not impart to knowledge the
absolute character which some persons attribute
to it, but even positively exclude it. Matter (or
existence, the object of sensible perception), only
falls within the sphere of our knowledge through
its qualities; mind only by its modifications;
and these qualities and modifications are all that
<em>can</em> be comprehended and expressed in the object.
The object itself, considered absolutely, remains
out of the reach of all perception.” It is an
obvious inference that, as we can only talk of
what we know, and as we can only know the relations
of things, words <em>are the medium of expressing</em>
(not the <em>nature</em> of things, which is incognisable),
but the <em>observed relations between things</em>.
They are revelations not of the outward, but of the
inward,&mdash;not of the universe, but of the thoughts
of man.</p>

<p>Leaving to metaphysicians all further discussion
of this question, we again recur to our
inquiry, How came words to be accepted as significant
of these relations? Thought<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
are inseparably connected; the very root of the
word Man<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> implies, in Sanskrit, “a thinking
being,” and it is well known that there is a close
connection between “ratio” and “oratio,” and
that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλογα ζῶα</span> means animals, not only “without
speech,” but “without reason.” Eloquence, in
fact, is genius, and the greatest poet or orator is
he who has most command over his native tongue.</p>

<p>It has even been a question with some philosophers
whether thought is <em>possible</em> without
speech,&mdash;whether, for instance, blind-deaf-mutes
(like the American girl, Laura Bridgman), are
capable<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> of exercising the faculty of reason until
they have been taught an artificial method of
expression?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Certain it is that the child begins to <em>speak</em>
when it begins to <em>think</em>, and that its first intelligent
perception of relations is followed by its first
articulate utterances. We may illustrate this
remark in an interesting manner. We find it
stated in the Jadschurveda, that the first words
uttered by the first man were, “I am myself,”
and that, when called, he answered, “I am he.”
With all due deference to the ancient philosopher
who held this belief, we may safely assert
that such a thing was impossible without some
special interposition; for the growth of a sense
of individuality is extremely slow, and comes to
children long after their main perceptions. A poet&mdash;in
whom nothing is more remarkable than his
profound learning and metaphysical accuracy&mdash;truly
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“The baby new to earth and sky,</p>
<p class="verse2">What time his tender palm is prest</p>
<p class="verse2">Against the circle of the breast,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hath never thought that ‘This is I:’</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">But as he grows he gathers much,</p>
<p class="verse2">And learns the use of ‘I’ and ‘me,’</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">And this gives us at once the true explanation
of the fact, that it is some time before a child
learns to regard itself as a subject, and therefore,
that it<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> objectises itself in all its language. It
would say, not “I want an apple,” but “Charlie
wants an apple;” not even “give <em>me</em>,”&mdash;so frequently
as “give Charlie.” When Hamlet signs
himself as ‘The machine that is to me Hamlet,’
he only shows, by an extreme instance, the
remarkable difficulty that a man always has in
mastering this very conception of individuality,
which the Hindoo philosophy would seem to
regard as a primitive intuition.</p>

<p>By these remarks we have greatly cleared the
way for our explanation of the manner in which
words originated;&mdash;an explanation<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
purely psychological, and which was first promulgated
in this shape by M. Steinthal.</p>

<p>Man has the faculty of interpretation, or of using
words for signs, as completely as he has the
faculties of sight and hearing; and words are the
means he employs for the exercise of the former
faculty, just as the eye and the ear are employed
as the organs of the latter.</p>

<p>The power of speech depends on the power of
abstraction, <em>i.e.</em>, of transforming intuitions into
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Let us explain. At the sight of a horse
galloping, or of a plain white with snow, the
primitive man formed, at first, one undivided
image; the motion and the horse, the field and
the snow, were unseparated. But, by language, the
act of running was distinguished from the creature
that ran, and the colour separated from the
thing coloured. Each of these two elements
became fixed in an isolated word, and so the
word dismembered the complete perception. But,
from another point of view, the word is more
extended than the presentation; <em>e.g.</em>, the word
“white” expresses not only an attribute of snow,
but of all white objects; its meaning, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
is more abstract and indeterminate than that of
“white snow.” Instead of only embracing an
existence, or an object in an accidental state, a word
represents the thing without its <em>accidental</em> characters,
which are removed by abstraction, and
indicates it under <em>all</em> the circumstances in which
it may be placed.</p>

<p>The transformation, then, of intuitions into
ideas, by the freedom and activity of the human
intelligence, constitutes the essence of a word,
although the speaker may be as unconscious of
the process as he is of the organic mechanisms
which give utterance to his thoughts.</p>

<p>I. ‘As for the conditions under which articulate
language first appeared, M. Steinthal represents
them as follows. At the origin of humanity the
soul and the body were in such mutual dependence
that all the emotions<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> of the soul had their
echo in the body, principally in the organs of the
respiration and the voice. This sympathy of
soul and body, still found in the infant and the
savage, was intimate and fruitful in the primitive
man; each intuition awoke in him an accent or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a sound.’ This was the first step; and in this fact
lies the germ of truth contained in the doctrines
of the analogists;<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> since there must have been
some reason in the nature of things, why certain
impressions or feelings were connected with certain
sounds rather than with certain others. We
may be totally unable to point out this connection
in many cases, and even while recognising
a natural relation between certain sounds of the
human voice and certain material phenomena, we
may deny the very possibility of such a relation
between a spiritual phenomenon and its
physical sign. And yet we feel a strong repugnance
at allowing caprice or chance to have any
considerable share in the origin of language.
It can, at least, be fairly argued that there is
nothing purely arbitrary in the work of the divine
Demiurgus.</p>

<p>II. ‘Another law, which played a no less
essential part in the creation of language, was
<em>the association<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> of ideas</em>. In virtue of this law,
the sound which accompanied an intuition, associated
itself in the soul with the intuition itself, so
closely that the sound and the intuition presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
themselves to the consciousness as <em>inseparable</em>,
and were equally inseparable in the recollection.’
This was the second step.</p>

<p>III. Finally, the word became a middle term
of reminiscence, a tach between the external
object and the inward impression. “The sound<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
became <em>a word</em> by forming a bond between the
image obtained by the vision, and the image
preserved in the memory; in other words, <em>it
acquired significance, and became an element of
language</em>. The image of the remembrance, and
the image of the vision, are not wholly identical;
<em>e.g.</em>, I see a horse; <em>no</em> other horse that I have
ever seen resembles it absolutely in colour, size,
&amp;c.: the general conception recalled by the word
‘horse’ involves only the abstracted<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> attributes
common to all the animals of the same genus.
It is this collection of common attributes that
constitutes the significance of the sound.”</p>

<p>Thus M. Steinthal attributes the appearance
of language to the unconscious action of psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
laws; and as these laws acted spontaneously
in the first human beings, it is quite
clear that these speculations involve no approval
of the untenable Epicurean belief in a long period
of mutism and savageness. We cannot but
think that the beauty, ingenuity, and simplicity
of these views will commend them to general
acceptance.</p>

<p>We may here give one or two passing hints of
the way in which these laws were influenced by
organism.</p>

<p>One very simple fact is, that of course the
<em>impressions</em>, &amp;c., which come earliest would naturally
be connected with the <em>sounds</em> that come
earliest. For instance, the words for father and
mother, which are alike half the world over, are,
as we should have expected, formed of easy and
simple<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> syllables; being indeed the first labial
sounds of the infant lisping: had we found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
any of them the letters which represent late-coming
and difficult sounds,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> we should have
been justly surprised.</p>

<p>Again, Grimm<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> has remarked that the more
ancient a language is, the more clearly do we
find in it the distinction between masculine and
feminine inflections. “Nothing,” adds M. Renan,
“proves it more strongly than the to-us-inexplicable
tendency which led the primitive nations to
suppose a sex in all beings, even inanimate ones.
A language, formed in our days, would suppress
the gender<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> in all cases, except perhaps, those
where men and women are concerned.” This
peculiarity is doubtless due to the influence of
women. In ancient times, the life of woman was
far more widely separated than now from that of
men; and even in later days, when they were
dwarfed in the isolation of the gynæceum, we can
easily understand how the peculiarities of their
life would have influenced the language they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
employed. The difference between their idioms
and those of men is still very incisive in some
African dialects; and the fact that men in speaking
<em>to</em> women are obliged to employ particular
inflections, proves that those inflections must have
been used by the women themselves. It is this
which causes the strange difference between Sanskrit
and Prâkrit; in the Hindoo dramas, Sanskrit
is used by the men, Prâkrit by the women.</p>

<p>But the difference is <em>due to the difference of
organisation</em>. If “a” and “i” are in all languages
the vowels characteristic of the <em>feminine</em>, it is
without doubt because those vowels are better
suited to the feminine organ than the masculine
sounds “o” and “ou.” A Hindoo commentator,
explaining the 10th verse of the Third
book of Manou,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> where it is commanded to
give to women sweet and agreeable names,
recommends that in these names the letter “a”
should predominate.</p>

<p>It is observable, too, that the influence of climate
on language is in point of fact another
result of the influence of organism. The idiom
of Sybaris is not that of Sparta. The languages of
the South are limpid, euphonic, and harmonious,
as though they had received an impress from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
transparency of their heaven, and the soft, sweet
sounds of the winds that sigh among their woods.
On the other hand, in the hirrients and gutturals,
the burr and roughness of the Northern tongues,
we catch an echo of the breaker bursting on their
crags, and the crashing of the pine-branch over
the cataract. Rousseau<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> has pointed to the fact
that the languages of the rich and prodigal
South, being the daughters of passion, are poetic
and musical, while those of the North, the
gloomy daughters of necessity, bear a trace of
their hard origin, and express by rude sounds
rude sensations. It is an additional argument
against the existence of a language primitive,
revealed, or innate, that every known language
bears on itself the deep traces of predominant
local influences. “It is for this reason that the
confusion of tongues and the dispersion of nations
are represented by Scripture as synchronous events
in the magnificent history of Babel, which, perhaps,
we may be permitted to regard as one of
those sublime parables so frequent in the sacred
books. This was the opinion of the great
Leibnitz.”</p>

<p>These are but easy illustrations of a wide and
difficult subject; but the influence of organism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
on language has not yet been very fully analysed,
and many of the laws which philologists have
advanced remain to some degree uncertain. Those
who desire to follow the subject may find some
very amusing illustrations in the pages of M.
Nodier, one of which we have<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> relegated into the
note.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE LAWS OF SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE, OR THE
CREATION OF ROOTS.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<p>“Nommer par la mimologie, s’enrichir par la comparaison, les
langues n’ont pas d’autre moyen: elles ne sortent pas de là.”&mdash;Nodier,
p. 39.</p>
</div>


<p>From the general question as to the manner in
which sounds acquired significance as <em>words</em>, we
proceed to the longer and wider inquiry as to
the causes which led to the choice of special
sounds in special significations; or, in other
words, we shall consider the origin of roots.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>When in the first chapter we proved that language
was neither innate nor revealed, we proved
implicitly that no words could be <em>purely</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
arbitrary.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The historic character of language,&mdash;the
fact that in innumerable cases we can distinctly
trace the laws which presided at the genesis of any
particular word,&mdash;strongly confirms our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i>
conclusion. The inference to be deduced from the
labours of all the best philologists, is that of Ihre,
“Non ut fungi nascuntur Vocabula.” We have
no reason to believe that any elements of language
were deduced from roots which of themselves
had no significance; and the more rigorous
and extensive the analysis to which even inflections
are subjected, the more clear is the proof
that they arise from the agglutination of separate
and significant words. “We believe,” says one
of the ablest of modern<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> inquirers, “that in
language <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex nihilo nihil fit</i>; and we are at a loss
to conceive how elements originally destitute of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
signification can determine the sense of anything
with precision. To assume that they have <em>no</em>
meaning, because we cannot always satisfactorily
explain it, is only an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">argumentum ad ignorantiam</i>.”</p>

<p>Nor must it be forgotten, that in endeavouring to
prove that in language <em>nothing is arbitrary</em>, we are
under a great disadvantage, because no existing
language has come to us in its primitive form.
Every language, even those which are most
ancient, and have long since ceased to be spoken,
bears in its records the traces of a more primitive
condition. Words, of which the composition was
originally clear, are worn and rubbed by the use
of ages, like the pebbles which are fretted and
rounded into shape and smoothness by the sea
waves on a shingly beach; or to use the more
appropriate image suggested by Goethe, their
meaning is often worn away like the image and
superscription of a coin. This process is so continuous,
that it is quite hopeless to recover the
original form of many words, or even to make a
probable<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> guess at their origin.</p>

<p>Language always tends to become mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
(<em>i.e.</em> unmeaning of <em>itself</em>) by corruption;<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and to
such an extent is this the case, that it is rather a
matter of astonishment when, after the lapse of
centuries, a word still retains the <em>obvious</em> traces
of its original form. And yet in spite of this we
can by induction discover from words themselves
the <em>main</em> laws which influenced the formation of
primitive speech.</p>

<p>The violent dislike which we instinctively feel
to the use of a word entirely new to us, and of
which we do not understand the source, is a
matter of daily experience; and the tendency to
<em>give</em> a meaning to adopted words by so changing
them as to remove their seemingly <em>arbitrary</em>
character has exercised a permanent and appreciable
influence on every language. An instance
or two will perhaps pave the way for a more
ready acceptance of our subsequent remarks.</p>

<p>When we go into a ship or factory, and inquire the
technical name of various parts of the machinery,
we are either unable to use the names from not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
catching the pronunciation, or, in attempting
to pronounce them we substitute for them
other words of similar sound and more significance.</p>

<p>It often happens that gardeners become acquainted
with new plants, or new species of old
plants, that are brought to them under a foreign
name; not understanding this name, they corrupt
it into some word which sounds like it, and
with which they are already familiar. To this
source of corruption we owe such words as
dandylion<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dent de lion</i>), rosemary (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ros marinus</i>),
gilly-flower (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">girofle</i>), quarter sessions rose (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des
quatre saisons</i>), Jerusalem artichoke (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">giresol</i>)
&amp;c. For the same reason (the dislike of terms
with which they are unacquainted) sailors corrupt
Bellerophon into Billy Ruffian: and we have
heard of a groom, who, having the charge of two
horses called Othello and Desdemona, christened
them respectively Old Fellow and Thursday
Morning. Lamprocles, the name of a horse of
Lord Eglintoun’s, was converted by the ring into
“Lamb and Pickles.” The same principle may
be seen at work among servants; we have heard
a servant systematically use the word “cravat”
for “carafe,” and astonish a gentleman by calmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
asking him at luncheon, “If she should fill his
<em>cravat</em> with water?”</p>

<p>The working of this tendency is all the more
curious from the fact that very often the corrupted
form of the word is wholly <em>inappropriate</em>,
although significant. There is no doubt that, in
most cases, we prefer a corruption, which is
appropriate <em>as well as</em> significant, and we find
instances<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> of this in such words as worm-<em>wood</em>
(<em>wermuth</em>), cray-<em>fish</em> (<em>écrévisse</em>), lant<em>horn</em>
(<em>laterna</em>), <em>bel</em>fry (<em>beffroi</em>), rake<em>hell</em> (<em>racaille</em>), <em>beef</em>eater
(<em>buffetier</em>), verdi<em>grease</em> (<em>verd de gris</em>), sparrow-<em>grass</em> (asparagus), &amp;c. Where, however, this
is unattainable, we are well content with some
significant corruption, for which we can invent or
imagine a meaning even if we are unaware of the
real explanation; as, for instance, in Charter
House (<em>Chartreuse</em>), “to a cow’s thumb” = exactly
(<em>à la coutume</em>), wiseacre (<em>weissager</em>), saltpetre
(<em>salpetra</em>), &amp;c. It is curious to find that in
the desire to understand, at any rate in <em>some</em>
degree, the words we use, the corrupted form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
often gives birth to a totally false explanation.
Thus Dr. Latham mentions<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> that the corruption of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Château Vert</i> into Shotover has led to the legend
that Little John <em>shot over</em> the hill of that name
near Oxford. Similar instances are supplied by
the legends of Veronica, and of St. Ursula with
her <em>eleven thousand</em> virgins.</p>

<p>It may seem that we have, in the course of this
chapter, made statements somewhat contradictory;
viz., that it is the tendency of language to become
mechanical (<em>i.e.</em>, arbitrary and conventional)
by corruption, and yet that there is an instinctive
dislike to the use of new words which convey
no intrinsic meaning to the mind of the speaker.
If we argued from the instances adduced in the
last pages, we <em>might</em> infer that language was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
originally arbitrary, and had been twisted into
meaning by subsequent use. We must, however,
draw attention to the fact that this latter phenomenon
is only observable on the naturalisation
of a word. A new word, however bright and
perfect in itself, is like a strange coin upon which
we look with suspicion, because we are unaccustomed
to its appearance. But when a word
is accepted and generally understood, when, in
fact, it has <em>become current</em>, we are then indifferent
to the amount of wear on the surface or even to
the complete obliteration of its original significance;
just in the same way as we do not trouble
ourselves to observe a coin which is in common
use, and pay no regard to the fact that its image
is confused, and its superscription undecipherable.
We might, for instance, find words which
have passed through both processes. Let us
suppose<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> that, in course of time, the word <em>sherbet</em>
had become corrupted first into <em>syrup</em>, then into
<em>shrub</em>; in this case we should have an exemplification
of a word first appropriately corrupted into
a familiar form in the course of naturalisation,
and then re-corrupted into a purely mechanical<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
word, by the ordinary progress of language. We
are therefore fairly entitled to infer from the dislike
to the introduction of any sound as a word,
when the sound is to the speaker an arbitrary
one, that the same feeling must have operated
at the dawning exercise of the faculty of speech;
while from the indifference which we exhibit to the
corruption of a word when it has once been
currently received; we may give a reason for our
inability to explain the origin of <em>all</em> primitive
roots, even while we assume with confidence that
every root was originally significative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Language may be regarded as the union of
words and grammar, of which words are analogous
to matter, and grammar to form;<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> regarded
in its <em>form</em> it was the expression of pure reason;
in its <em>matter</em> it was only the reflex of sensuous
life. The absence of any definite grammar constitutes
an <em>inorganic</em> language like the Chinese.
Those who have derived language exclusively from
sensation are as much mistaken as those who
have assigned to ideas a purely material origin.
Sensation furnished the variable and accidental
element, which might have been quite other than
it is, (<em>i.e.</em>, the words); but the grammar of a
language, (the rational form, without which words
could not have been a language), is its pure and
transcendental element which gives to the result
its truly human character. Words can no more
form a language than sensations can produce a
man. That which originates language, like that
which originates thought, is the logical relation
which the soul establishes between external
things.</p>

<p>We may now state our belief that <em>almost all</em>
primitive roots were obtained by <em>Onomatopœia</em>,
<em>i.e.</em>, by an imitation with the human voice of
the sounds of inanimate nature. Onomatopœia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
sufficed to represent the vast majority of physical
facts and external phenomena; and nearly all the
words requisite for the expression of metaphysical
and moral convictions were derived from these<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
onomatopœic roots by <em>analogy</em> and <em>metaphor</em>.</p>

<p>We have purposely modified our statement of
these conclusions, because there is too great a
tendency to general assertions, against which, as
W. von Humboldt well remarked, science should
be always on its guard. It is a saying of
Schlegel’s, that, so great is the variety of procedure
in different languages, that there is
scarcely one language which might not be chosen
to illustrate some particular hypothesis. For
instance, the <em>sole</em> similarity between Chinese and
Sanskrit rests in the fact that both aim at the
same end, viz., the expression of thought. Thus
onomatopœia is far from being found in all languages
in the same degree, and it is much more
observable in the Semitic than in the Indo-European
family, in which, however ancient the
word may be proved to be, it constantly bears
witness to those poetic and philosophic instincts
of our race which clearly prove that reason was
not a slow and painful growth.</p>

<p>“Caprice has no influence in the formation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
language.” Without believing in any universal,
necessary, intrinsic connection between word
and thing, we are forced to believe that there was,
in every case, a <em>subjective</em> connection. The appropriateness
of the word resided, not in the object
named, for in this case there would have been a
striking similarity in all the languages of the
human race, but in the mind of the name-giver,
who, of necessity, stamped the word with the
impress of his own individuality. In direct
proportion to the delicacy of his perceptions, was
the fitness of the words he used; for those words
expressed relations capable of being viewed in
widely different aspects, so that the finer and
more keen was the man’s power of perceiving
analogies, the greater was his capacity for the
expression of facts. The true formula is that
“the connection between a word and its meaning
is never <em>necessary</em>, and never arbitrary, but
always results from a reasonable motive.”</p>

<p>But what the motives were, which in many
cases led to the choice of particular sounds, it is
beyond our power to conjecture or ascertain.
The richness and delicacy of the appellative
faculty in the savage and the infant must necessarily
have existed in the primitive man, and, as
it decayed with the decay of all necessity for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
exercise, we are unable to point out, with any
certainty, the tendencies by which it was actuated.
There is no waste in the economy of nature; a
faculty ceases when it is no longer required, just
as the outer leaves which ensheathe the nascent
germ wither and drop off when the germ has
acquired sufficient vitality for its own preservation.</p>

<p>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tecum habita</span>” was not the motto of the
early inhabitants of the earth. They lived with
the external world. The cataract “haunted them
like a passion,” and they heard voices in the
dawning of the sun and the murmur of the
wind. The heavens declared the glory of God,
and the firmament showed his handiwork; day
unto day uttered speech, and night showed knowledge
unto night. The soul of the first man, to
use the beautiful expression of Leibnitz, was a
concentric mirror of nature, in the midst of
whose works he lived. Language was the echo
of nature in his individual consciousness. The
action of the mind produced language by a
spontaneous repercussion of the perceptions
received.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It is the mind which creates and forms;
but this power of the mind is one reacting only
upon impressions received from the world without.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
The imitative power of language consists
in an artistic imitation, not of things, but of the
rational impression which an object produces by
its qualities.</p>

<p>The fact, therefore, that the imitation is <em>artistic</em>,
and is influenced by subjective considerations,
would prevent us from being surprised or disappointed,
if we do not always see the working of
this principle, in cases where we should have
expected it. In such words as the Hebrew
<em>Khâtzatz</em> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">קָצַץ</span>), and <em>Schephifoun</em> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">שְׁפִיפוֹן</span>) we
seem to hear the shearing off of the cut material,
and the lithe rustle of the horned snake through
the withered leaves. But words so remarkably
suggestive are comparatively rare, and in most
cases the imitation is more concealed. Nothing,
however, more powerfully proves the tendency of
language, in this respect, than the fact that words
of a harsh meaning usually assume a rough, harsh
form, and words that imply something sweet and
tender seem to breathe the sensation they
describe. The German word (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">entsetzen</span>) “terror,”
means, etymologically, a mere “displacement,”
yet who does not see that it has caught an instinctive
echo from the thing which it describes,
which, in no degree, depends on association;&mdash;that,
independently of imagination it betrays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
something harsh by its mere form. That there is
a consonance between external sounds and the
processes of the mind, is decisively shown by the
fact that whole languages have thus caught the
impress of the associations by which they have
been evolved. In the soft and vowelled undersong
of modern Italian, who does not recognise the
result of climate and natural character? The
Doric seems to recall to us the sound of martial
flutes, while the Hebrew, in its stern and solemn
pomp, tells like one vast onomatopœia, of the
mighty mission which it was destined to accomplish;
every single word of it seems to shine
with that mysterious light which lent strange
lustre to the letters of it on the gems of the
sacerdotal robe. “When,” says M. Vinet, “you
hear the vast word haschâmaïm, which names
the heavens, unfold itself like a vast pavilion,
your intelligence&mdash;before knowing what the word
signifies&mdash;expects something magnificent; no
mean object could have been named thus; it is
better than an onomatopœia, although it is not
one.”<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The exuberance and uncontrolled variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
which characterises the primitive languages is a
proof of the extraordinarily developed resources
of the power of interpretation, or the faculty of
converting sounds into signs, so long as the
exercise of that faculty continued to be necessary.
The richest idioms are always the most spontaneous
and unconscious. It is obviously impossible
for us, with our intellectual refinements
and blunted senses, to rediscover the ancient
harmony which existed between thought and
sensation, between nature and man. As we are
no longer obliged to create language, we have
entirely lost a crowd of processes which tended
to its elaboration. But among the early races
there was a delicate tact, enabling them to seize
on those attributes which were capable of supplying
them with appellatives, the exquisite subtlety
of which we are unable any longer to conceive.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
They saw a thousand things at once, and indeed
their language-creating faculty mainly consisted
in a power of seizing upon relations. Our very
civilisation has robbed us of this happy and
audacious power. Nature spoke more to them
than to us, or rather they found in themselves a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
secret echo which answered to all external voices,
and returned them in articulations&mdash;in <em>words</em>.
Hence those swift interchanges of meaning
which we, with our less flashing intelligence, are
almost unable to follow.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> ‘Who can seize again
those fugitive impressions of the naïfs creators of
language in words which have undergone so
many changes, and which are so far from their
original acceptation? Who can rediscover the
capricious paths which the imagination followed,
and the associations of ideas which guided it, in
that spontaneous work, wherein sometimes man,
sometimes nature, reunited the broken thread of
analogies, and wove their reciprocal actions into
an indissoluble unity?’</p>

<p>Wherever the faculty of creating appellations
is still required, we still find a capacity for its
exercise. For instance, it has been asserted that
“the day after an army has encamped in an
unknown country all the important or characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
places have their names without any convention
having intervened.” We find an analogous
case in the fact that the French and English, by
common consent, called the Turks Bono Johnny;
the exact reasons for such a nomenclature would
be perhaps difficult to determine, and who shall
say who first used or invented the term? yet it
became current in a day or two. It is equally
difficult to trace the history and origin of various
popular phrases which every now and then have a
brief run in ordinary phraseology.</p>

<p>A still more remarkable exemplification that
the faculty of the original name-giver is not
wholly lost to mankind may be seen in the secret,
subtle, almost imperceptible, and sometimes
quite unconscious analogies which give currency
to a common nickname. At schools I have often
known boys whose sobriquet was a vocable, in
itself apparently meaningless and incapable of
any circumstantial explanation, which was yet
universally adopted, and was adopted <em>because</em> it
presented some unintelligible appropriateness.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
A modern prince is called Plomb-plomb, and
known quite commonly by that designation: yet
there is no such word as Plomb-plomb in the
French language, and the very origin of the term
is unknown to the majority of the Prince’s contemporaries.
We may be quite sure, however,
that the name involves either a lively onomatopœia
or a striking allusion.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p class="verse0">“The sound must seem an echo to the sense.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></p>
</div></div>


<p>Since the human voice is at once a <em>sound</em> and
a <em>sign</em>, it was of course natural to take the sound
of the voice as a sign of the sounds of nature.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
In short, to recall a sound by its echo in the voice
is as obviously natural a proceeding as to recall
an object to the memory by drawing the picture
of its form. In both cases we act upon the senses
by means of imitation; and if the human race
had not been endued with the organs of hearing
doubtless a language for the eye would have been
invented, just as Philomela, when deprived of
her tongue, made known, by embroidery, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
miserable tale. A word formed on the principle of
imitation, is said to be formed by onomatopœia,
and although the traces of such an origin are
rapidly lost, yet amid the almost infinite modifications
of which a few roots are capable, it is
astonishing how vast a number of words may be
ultimately deduced from a single onomatopœic
sound.</p>

<p>How universal and instinctive the procedure
is, may be observed among infants and savages.</p>

<p>In the nursery the onomatopœan sounds moo,
baa, bow-wow, &amp;c., are the steps by which the
child passes gradually to the conception of cow,
lamb, and dog. So in Swiss<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> bààgen is to
bleat, and báágeli (in nursery language), a sheep.
The very name <em>cow</em>, Germ. <em>kuh</em>, Sansks. <em>gao</em>, has
a similar origin, as βοῦς, bos, ox, Sansks. <em>uxan</em>,
probably has also. There is little doubt that the
word, cat (Germ. <em>katze</em>), is an imitation of the
sound made by a cat spitting, which is one of the
most peculiar characteristics of the feline race.
It must, however, be admitted that there is no
sibilant in “kater.” We have all heard the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of the Englishman in China, who, wishing to
know the contents of a dish which was lying
before him, said inquiringly, “Quack, quack?”
and received in answer, the word, “bow-wow!”
These two imitations served all the purposes of a
more lengthened conversation. It was probably,
by a strictly analogous process, that an immense
multitude of such roots was primitively formed.</p>

<p>Again, it is impossible to look over any list of
words collected from the language of a savage
community without recognising the extensive use
of the same method.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The repetition of syllables
is an almost certain sign of its working. Thus,
Ai-ai is an imitation of the cry of the sloth, and
tuco-tuco is the name of a small rodent in Buenos
Ayres. Mr. Longfellow has supplied us with
many such words from the languages of North
America, in his poem of “Hiawatha,”&mdash;as Kahgahgee,
the raven; Minnehaha laughing-water,
&amp;c. “In uncivilised languages,<a name="FNanchor_106a" id="FNanchor_106a"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> the consciousness
of the imitative character of certain words is
sometimes demonstrated by their composition
with verbs,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> like say or do, to signify making a
noise like that represented by the word in question.
Thus, in Galla, from <em>djeda</em>, to say, or <em>goda</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to make or do, are formed <em>cacak-djeda</em>, to crack;
<em>trrr-djeda</em>, to chirp; <em>dadada-djeda</em>, to beat; <em>djamdjam-goda</em>,
to champ.”</p>

<p>We do not think that the extent to which onomatopœia
may be proved to be an instrument of
language has been sufficiently admitted. It was the
most natural starting-point for the intelligence on
its path towards expression. A nascent language
enriches itself by ceaseless imitations of elementary
sounds, animal cries, and the noises
produced by mechanical contrivances, and we
shall trace hereafter the innumerable applications
in which such terms can be at once employed.
Some writers even go so far as to assert that
this is the <em>only</em> original principle of language,
and that we even learned our first consonant from
the bleating of the sheep, for which reason,
according to Pierius Valerianus, a lamb was the
hieroglyphical emblem of the verb! We have
already rejected this extension of the theory; but,
at the same time, we can readily believe the
assertion, that the <em>peculiarities</em> of articulation in
certain countries may be not only modified, but
even originated by the existence of remarkable
natural sounds in the countries where these peculiarities
occur. It has been said, for instance,
“that in some of the American languages, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
are strident consonants evidently formed from
the hiss of certain serpents unknown in our
temperate regions, and that the click of the
Hottentot dialects recalls a species of cry peculiar
to the tigers which <em>ranque</em>.” The latter word is
an onomatopœian, probably borrowed by Buffon
from the Philomela of Albus Ovidius Juventinus,
in which occurs the line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse0">“Tigrides indomitæ <em>rancant</em><a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> rugiuntque leones.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>What this peculiar sound may be, we do not
know, but can hardly reconcile this suggestion of
Nodier with the statement, that the name,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Hott-en-tot
is itself onomatopœian, having been given
by the first Dutch settlers, because this click
would sound to a stranger like a perpetual
repetition of the syllables <em>hot</em> and <em>tot</em>. It is a
curious fact that Palamedes is said to have learnt,
from the noise of cranes, the four letters which
he added to the Greek alphabet; and it is certainly
a confirmation of these remarks, that although no
language possesses in its alphabet a power of
expressing every possible articulation, yet no
nation’s language is quite deficient in the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of expressing, by imitation, the cries of its indigenous
animals.</p>

<p>It is wonderful that the knowledge and observation
of facts like these did not lead the philologists
of antiquity to a solution of their disputes
about the natural or conventional origin of
languages. The age of Psammetichus evinced
its interest in the question, and if it had been
content to observe its own experiment, instead of
making it the prop to a “foregone conclusion,”
philosophers might have agreed, long ago, in
believing, that man was assisted by nature in the
development of his implanted powers, and that,
like every infant of his race, he framed into living
speech the sounds by which his senses were first
impressed.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> When the first man gave names to
the animals, which, as we have already seen, he
was enabled to do by the reasonable use of his
own faculties, and not at the dictation of a voice
from heaven, he could not have been guided by
<em>any</em> principle so obvious, so easy, or so appropriate
as an artistic reproduction of the sounds
which they uttered.</p>

<p>But how, it may be asked, is the voice capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of rendering even the feeblest echo of all the
myriad utterances of the earth and air, the voices
of the desert and mountain,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“The echoes of illimitable forests,</p>
<p class="verse0">The murmur of unfathomable seas”?</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">We answer that the imitation is not, and does
not profess to be a dull, dead, passive echo of
the <em>sound</em>, but of the impression produced by it
upon the sentient being; it is not a <em>mere</em> spontaneous
repercussion of the perception received;
but a repercussion modified <em>organically</em> by the
configurations of the mouth, and <em>ideally</em> by the
nature of the analogy perceived between the
sound and the object it expressed. “The organs
of that wonderful musical instrument, the mouth,
are the throat, the palate, the tongue, the teeth,
the lips.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> This then is the subjective organon of
language, the physiological vehicle for that proto-plastic
art, speech, which combines architecture
and music, the plastic and the picturesque.
Johannes Müller has developed this physiologically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Sir John Herschell acoustically.” The
mere power of imitation would not have helped
mankind a single step towards language any more
than it has helped the parrot or the jay,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> had it
not been for the infinitely nobler faculty which
enabled us to perceive the meaning of the sounds
we uttered, and to use them as the signs of our
inward conceptions,&mdash;a faculty which has implanted
in language its principle of development,
and which constitutes the distinction between the
chatterings of a jackdaw and the eloquence of
a man.</p>

<p>This alone is a clear proof, if proof were wanted,
that language is the result of intelligence, as well
as of instinct; and that the human reason was not
a gradual acquisition of a once brutish race.</p>

<p>But though the power of imitation by the voice
of the sounds of the unintelligent creation be
small in comparison with those other powers
which constitute our pre-eminence, yet how perfect
is that gift in itself,&mdash;how wondrous the
organism by which it is effected! The mouth is
admirably framed for intelligent and harmonious
utterance; it is at once an organ, and a flute,&mdash;a
trumpet and a harp. Its sublime construction
will make it the eternal despair of mechanicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and the songs which it can modulate, are superior
to all the melodies of artificial music. The intelligence
of man enables him alone to use this
glorious instrument, as God intended it to be
used. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il avait</span>,” says M. Nodier, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans ses
poumons un soufflet intelligent et sensible, dans
ses lèvres un limbe épanoui, mobile, extensible,
rétractile, qui jette le son, qui le modifie, qui le
renforce, qui l’assouplit, qui le contraint, qui le
voile, qui l’éteint; dans sa langue un marteau
souple, flexible, onduleux, qui se replit, qui
s’accourcit, qui s’étend; qui se meut, et qui s’enterpose
entre ses valves, selon qu’il convient
retenir ou d’épancher la voix, qui attache ses
touches avec âpreté ou qui les effleure avec mollesse;
dans ses dents un clavier ferme, aigu, strident;
à son palais un tympan grave et sonore:
luxe inutile pourtant, s’il n’avait pas eu la pensée;
et celui qui a fait ce qui est n’a jamais rien fait
d’inutile.&mdash;L’homme parla parce qu’il pensait.</span>”</p>

<p>The plain elementary sounds of which the
human voice is capable are about twenty; and
yet it has been calculated by the mathematician
Tacquet, that one thousand million writers, in
one thousand million years, could not write out
all the combinations of the twenty-four letters of
the alphabet, if each of them were daily to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
out forty pages of them, of which each page
should contain different orders of the twenty-four
letters. Of course, a very small number only
of these permutations are at all required for every
purpose of life. “And thus it is,” says the ingenious
author of<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>Hermes, “that to principles
apparently so trivial as about twenty plain
elementary sounds, we owe that variety of articulate
voices, which have been sufficient to explain
the sentiments of so innumerable a multitude, as
all the present and past generations of men.”</p>

<p>But it may be objected that if we admit such
latitude to the use of onomatopœia in the formation
of language, we should find among all languages
a much greater identity than actually
exists in the terms expressive of physical facts.
This by no means follows. We have already
seen that words express the <em>relations</em> of things,
and the relations of things are almost infinite,
and especially must they have been so to the
delicate senses of the youthful world. Let us
take the instance of the thunder: the impression
produced by it is by no means single and distinct.
To one man it may appear like a dull rumble, to
another like a sudden crackling explosion, and to
a third as a breaking forth of flashing light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Hence come a multitude of names. Adelung
professed to have collected 353 imitative appellations
from the European languages alone; and
it is not difficult to see that a similar<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> principle
was at work in the Chinese <em>ley</em> (pronounced <em>r</em>ey),
the Greenland <em>kallak</em>, and the Mexican <em>tlatlatnitzel</em>.
Similarly, “the explosion of a gun which an English
boy imitates by the exclamation <em>Bang-fire</em>, is
represented in French by <em>Pouf</em>! The neighing
of a horse is expressed by the French <em>hennir</em>;
Italian, <em>nitrire</em>; Spanish, <em>rinchar</em>, <em>relinchar</em>;
German, <em>wiehern</em>; Swedish, <em>wrena</em>, <em>wrenska</em>;
Dutch, <em>runniken</em>, <em>ginniken</em>, <em>brieschen</em>, words in
which it is difficult to see a glimpse of resemblance,
although we can hardly doubt that they
all take their rise in the attempt at direct<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> representation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of the same sound.” In the same way,
no one will deny that “ding-dong,” and the word
“bilbil,” to ring, in the Galla language, are
onomatopœians to represent the sound of a bell,
and yet the two have hardly an element in
common.</p>

<p>It has been noticed that birds are often named
on this principle; as night-jar, whip-poor-will,
cock, cuckoo, crow, crane, crake, quail, curlew,
jay, chough, owl, turtle, &amp;c.; and where the bird
has one very marked cry we find a great similarity
in the names by which it is known. Take for
instance the <em>peetwit</em>,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Scandinavian <em>pee-weip</em>, <em>tee-whoap</em>;
French, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dishuit</i>; Dutch, <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kiewit</i>; German,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kiebitz</i>; Swedish, <i lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">kowipa</i>. But we should
not expect this to be the case when a bird has a
great variety of different sounds. The nightingale,
according to Bechstein, has twenty distinct
articulations, and it is therefore not surprising
that even in the European languages it is known
under widely different names. And besides
names which are derived from its song (<em>e.g.</em>
bulbul), it might be called from some other attribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
entirely distinct from this, as perhaps in
the Latin name <em>luscinia</em>; although, if this be the
case, it is interesting to see how imitation asserts
its prerogative in the modern names<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">usignuolo</i>
(Italian), <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ruyseñol</i> (Spanish), <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rossignol</i>
(French), <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">rousinol</i> (Portuguese), which are probably
corruptions of the diminutive <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lusciniola</i>,
used by Plautus.</p>

<p>In some cases an onomatopœian root is so natural
as to run through all families of languages;
<em>e.g.</em> the root lh or lk to imitate the sound and
action of licking, as Hebrew <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">לָחַךְ</span>; Arabic, <em>lahika</em>;
Syriac, <em>lah</em>; λείχω, <em>lingo</em>, <em>ligurio</em>, <em>lingua</em>, <em>leccare</em>,
<em>lechen</em>, <em>lécher</em>; it is the same with the roots grf
to express gripping, kr to express crying, and
many others. The practice is, however (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
we have already remarked), far more prominent
in the Semitic than in the Indo-European family,
and this is the cause of the extraordinary richness
of synonyms in Hebrew and Arabic for the expression
of natural objects. It is said that in
Arabic there are 500 names for the lion, 200 for
the serpent, more than eighty for honey, 400 for
sorrow, and (what is quite incredible unless
every periphrasis be counted a name) no less
than 1,000 for a sword. M. de Hammer, an unimpeachable
authority, has, in a little treatise on
the subject, counted also 5,744 words relating to
the camel. The ancient Saxon is said to have
had fifteen words for the sea; and if we allowed
merely poetical expressions like “the blue,” we
might say the same of modern English.</p>

<p>Wide dialectic variety naturally results from a
nomadic life; and it is easy to see how this
extraordinary exuberance of primitive language,
and the uncontrolled rapidity with which it exercised
its powers of nomenclature, would tend,
while writing and literature were as yet unknown,
to make mutually unintelligible the language
of different tribes.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This confusion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
speech would, of course, be the most powerful
impediment in the course of ambition, and
would tend to defeat the attempts to construct
and perpetuate a universal empire. It may have
been the providential agent to assert for the
human race, “a nobler destiny than to become
the footstool of a few families.” This is strikingly
shadowed forth in the Scripture narrative
of the builders of Babel, which many competent
authorities have considered as applicable to only
a single family of nations, and have regarded in
the light rather of “a sublime emblem, than of a
material verity.”</p>

<p>The confusion of tongues is not represented
in Scripture as a punishment,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> but as the providential
prevention of an arrogant attempt to
establish among mankind a spurious centre of
unity. It seems to have frustrated the lawless
thirst for power which actuated the tribe of Nimrod.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
But even if regarded as a punishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
God’s punishments are but blessings in disguise.
The dispersion of nations has acted as a stimulant
to the powers of humanity, and has been
the direct cause of a beneficial variety in thought
and action; and in the same way the diversity of
languages has proved to be (as we shall see hereafter)
an indisputable advantage, by adding fresh
lustre continually to those conceptions which by
long habit become pale and dim. Yet this dispersion
and diversity is but the accident of a
fallen state, and in the renovated earth&mdash;(though
it can never be while nations are in their present
condition)&mdash;all men will perhaps speak the same
perfect<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> universal speech.</p>

<p>There are two totally distinct points from
which an imitative root can take its origin. The
first is from an artistic reproduction of the sounds
of the outer world; the second is from the expressions
of fear or anger, of disgust or joy,
which the impression of any event or spectacle
may call forth in the human being. The first of
these elements is the onomatopœic; the second,
the interjectional. These two sources have not
been kept sufficiently clear and distinct, and the
latter especially has been by many philologists
entirely overlooked. We will proceed to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
some remarks on both. The instances which we
shall select might be almost indefinitely extended,
and even were they less numerous we might
perhaps be allowed to use the words of President
de Brosses, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La preuve connue d’un grand
nombre de mots d’une espèce doit établir une
précepte générale sur les autres mots de même
espèce, à l’origine desquels on ne peut plus
remonter.</span>”</p>

<p>As instances of the words which have arisen
from the interjectional element, <em>i.e.</em> from the
sounds whereby we express natural emotions, we
may mention the large group of words that spring
from the root “ach,” ah! oh! as utterances of
pain, as ἄχος, ἀχέω, <em>achen</em>, ache; or from the
sound of groaning, as <em>væ</em>, <em>wehe</em>, woe, wail; or
from an expression of disgust, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">putere</i> (Fr.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">puer</span>), foul, fulsome; or from smacking the lips
with pleasure, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γλύκυς</span>, <em>dulcis</em>, <em>geschmack</em>, &amp;c.
This latter class is very widely extended, even
in the Semitic languages, as we have already
shown in the case of the root <em>lk</em> (see <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>).
From the expression of disgust and fear, we get
awe, ugly, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγάομαι, ἀγάζομαι</span> and their cognates;
from shuddering, the roots of φρίσσω, bristle,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hérisser</i>, &amp;c.; from the first sounds of infancy, we
get babe, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bambino</i>, babble, and many more; from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
sounds of anger, “huff,” and others; lastly, from
“prut,” a sound of arrogance, we get the word
“proud,” “pride,” as in German, “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">trotzig</i>,”
haughty, from “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">trotz</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> an interjection of defiance
and contempt.</p>

<p>The other class of onomatopœias is far more
extensive, and embraces the widest possible range
of inanimate sounds. They may be ranged
under the following heads; and although the
examples are all taken from the<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>English language,
they might be paralleled in almost any
other.</p>

<p>1. Animal sounds, as quack, cackle, roar,
neigh, whinny, bellow, mew, pur, croak, caw,
chatter, bark, yelp, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. Inarticulate human sounds, as laugh, cough,
sob, sigh, moan, shriek, yawn, whoop, weep, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Collision of hard bodies, represented by p,
t, k; as clap, rap, tap, flap, slap, rat-tat, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. Collision of softer bodies, represented by b,
d, g; as dab, dub, bob, thud, dub-a-dub, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Motion through the air, represented by z,
&amp;c.; as whizz, buzz, sough, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. Resonance, represented by m, n, &amp;c.; as
clang, knell, ring, twang, clang, din, &amp;c.</p>

<p>7. Motion of liquids, &amp;c., represented by sibilants,
as clash, splash, plash, dash, swash, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These are but specimens of the wide extent of
these words in a language by no means the most
remarkable for its adoption of onomatopœia.
There are even broad general laws by which the
various degrees of intensity in sound are expressed
by the modification of vowels. Thus,
high notes are represented by i, low broad sounds
by a, and the change of a or o to i has the effect
of diminution, as we see by comparing the words
clap, clip, clank, clink, pock, peck, cat, kitten,
foal, filly, tramp, trip, nob, nipple, &amp;c. Another
way of diminishing intensity is to soften a final
letter, as in tug, tow, drag, draw, swagger, sway,
stagger, stay, &amp;c. Reduplication of syllables is a
mode of expressing continuance, as in murmur,
&amp;c., and this effect is also produced by the addition
of r and l, as in grab, grapple, wrest, wrestle,
crack, crackle, dab, dabble, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is easy to see from the above examples that
the onomatopœia and the interjection are the
points from which language has developed itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>,
and from which “two separate lines of concurrent
and<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> simultaneous evolution have proceeded.”
The manner in which the various parts of speech
grew out of these elements, and which of them
may be supposed to be logically or actually anterior
to the rest, is a wide and difficult subject
of inquiry on which much uncertainty must
necessarily prevail, and with which we are here
unconcerned.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that, for some reason or
other, many of our English onomatopœians are
regarded as in some degree beneath the dignity
of words, and are supposed to partake of the
nature of vulgarity.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Yet with great inconsistency
the places in which poets have been most
successful in producing “an echo of the sound to
the sense” are generally regarded with especial
favour. The classic poets used this ornament
with the most fastidious good taste. Even the
ancients had learned to admire the rhyming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
termination by which Homer faintly recalls the
humming of the summer swarms, in the lines&mdash;</p>

numberless admirers.</p>

<p>The greatest of our modern poets, Mr. Tennyson,
has perhaps been more unsparing and more
successful in his use of this figure than any of
his predecessors, and a few passages will show
that onomatopœia judiciously used is capable of
the noblest application. Take, for instance, the
leap of a cataract, in&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">Where the river sloped</p>
<p class="verse0">To plunge in cataract, shattering on black blocks</p>
<p class="verse0">Its breadth of thunder;</p>

<p class="noindent">or the shock of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mélée</i>, in&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="noindent">or, finally, what can be more perfect than the

us by the perfect adaptation of sound to sense,
in the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">For the fleet drew near,</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Touched</em>, <em>clinked</em>, and <em>clashed</em>, and vanished.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Yet in all these cases we believe that it is to the
language and not to the poet that the main credit
is due. The language is the perfect instrument,
and in the poet’s hands it is used with perfect
power; but were it not for the original perfection
of his instrument he would be unable to produce
such rich and varied results; he would be unable
to place the picture before the eye by bringing
into play that swift and subtle law of association
whereby a reproduction of the sounds at once
recalls to the inner eye the images or circumstances
with which they are connected. In every
case the consummate art and skill of the writer
consists simply in choosing the proper words for
the thought which he wishes to express, which
words are always the simplest. Appropriate<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
language is and always must be the most effective,
and when a writer <em>clearly goes out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
way</em> to produce an effect he generally loses his
effectiveness by abandoning simplicity. How
much onomatopœia degenerates in a less skilful
and artistic hand we might see in many instances,
were not the selection of them an invidious task.</p>

<p>In short, an exquisite and instinctive taste can
only decide on the extent to which this figure
may be <em>consciously</em> used. We feel that Virgil
was right in rejecting Ennius’s</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse0">At tuba terribili sonitu <em>taratantara</em> dicit,</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">as the imitation of a trumpet-blast; and none but
a comic poet (like Swift) would use rub-a-dub,
dub-a-dub in English to express the beating of a
drum: and yet who was ever otherwise than
delighted with the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τήνελλα</span>, in which Archilochus
imitated the twang of a harp-string, and
which the Greeks used ever afterwards as an
expression of joyous triumph? Again, none but
a comedian could have ventured on so direct an
imitation of sounds as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βρεκεκεκέξ κοάξ κοάξ</span>, and yet
no one could object to the pretty line in which
Ovid tries to produce the same impression:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse0">Quamquam sunt <em>sub aquâ, sub aquâ</em> maledicere tentant.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The misuse of language fails to produce the
echo which its simple and natural use would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
have failed to awake. In short, it is in many
cases impossible to use language which shall be
at once specific and appropriate without being
forced to adopt imitative words. There is no
style required in order to speak of the booming
of the cannon, the twang of the bowstring, the
hurtling of the arrow, the tolling or pealing of
the bell, the rolling or throbbing of the drum,
the sough or whisper of the breeze, because in
each case the proper word is ready for us at
once in the language which we speak, and if
we are to speak naturally we can use no other.
The harmonies of language arise mainly from
this power of imitation, and a sensuous language
is always energetic, poetic, passionate.</p>

<p>The most brilliant of modern philosophers, M.
Victor Cousin, in endeavouring to refute the
conclusion of Locke that all words draw their
first origin from sensible ideas, adduces the pronoun
“I” and the verb “to be” as words which
are primitive, indecomposible, and irreducible in
every language with which he is acquainted&mdash;as
words which are pure signs, representing nothing
whatever except the meaning conventionally attached
to them, and having no connection with
sensible ideas.</p>

<p>Whatever may become of M. Cousin’s general
proposition, the instances which he has chosen
to support it are very unfortunate, for it may be
clearly proved that these words, abstract as they
may appear, are yet derived from sensible images.
An examination of them will therefore help us to
gain a little insight into the origin of language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and perhaps strengthen our suspicion that even
the most subjective words, which merely intimate
intellectual relations, even the words which express
the essential categories, may be ultimately
proved to have a metaphorical and not a psychological
origin. Such a conviction will by no
means impair the dignity of language, or cast a
slur on the majesty of thought; for if the entire
lexicon of every language be capable of being
reduced to a number of sensational roots, the no
less important element of Grammar always remains
as the indisputable result of the pure
reason. And not only so, but even the possibility
of accepting imitative roots as <em>signs</em> of the
thing imitated, supposes (as M. Maine<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> de Biran
acutely observes) the pre-existence of an activity
superior to sensation, whereby the thinking
being places himself outside the circle of impressions
and images in order to signify and note
them.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that the word by which
a man characterises himself in relation to his
own consciousness would be of a very mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and abstract character, because it must express
the notion of individuality, which might be regarded
as a very primary intuition. This, however,
is far from being the case. Man regarded
himself as an object before he learnt to regard
himself as a subject, and hence “the objective
cases of the personal as well as of the other pronouns
are always older than the subjective,” and
the Sanskrit <i>mâm</i>, <i>ma</i> (Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">με</span>, Latin <i>me</i>) is
earlier than <i>aham</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐγών</span>, and <i>ego</i>). We might
have conjectured this from the fact already
noticed, that children learn to speak of themselves
in the third person, <em>i.e.</em> regard themselves
as objects long before they acquire the power of
representing their material selves as the instrument
of an abstract entity. A child<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> does not
attain to the free use of the pronoun “I” until
the acquisition of formal grammar outstrips the
psychological growth. And the same takes place
with other personal pronouns. Man’s primary
consciousness of his own existence is nearly
simultaneous with the belief that he is something
separate from the not-me, the external
world. But at first he would only regard this
external world as an immense inseparable phenomenon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and it would be some time before he
could “invest the<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> not-me with the powers of
agency and will which we experience in ourselves.”</p>

<p>But whether the conception of individuality be
regarded as coming early or late, so far is the
pronoun “I” from involving any sublime intrinsic
meaning, that it was originally a demonstrative
monosyllable, indicative of a particular position.
“In fact,” says Dr. Donaldson, “the primitive
pronouns must have been very simple words, for
the first and easiest articulations would naturally
be adopted to express the primary intuition of
space. These little vocables denote only the
immediate relations of locality. It is reasonable
to suppose that the primitive pronouns would be
designations of <em>here</em> and <em>there</em>, of the subject and
object as contrasted and opposed to one another.
As soon as language becomes a medium of communication
between two speaking persons, a
threefold distinction at once arises between the
<em>here</em> or subject, the <em>there</em> or object, and the person
spoken to or considered as a subject in himself,
though an object in regard to the speaker.”
In other words, there are “three<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> primitive relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of position: here, near to here, and there,
or juxtaposition, proximity, and distance. The
three primitive articulations which are used (in
Greek) to express these three relations of position,
are the three primitive <em>tenues</em>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Π, Ϙ, Τ</span>,
pronounced pa, qua, ta, which we shall call the
first, second, and third pronominal elements.
The first pronominal element denoting juxtaposition,
or <em>here</em>, is used to express (a) the first
personal pronoun; (b) the first numeral; (c) the
point of departure in motion. The second pronominal
element denoting proximity, or <em>near to
the here</em>, is used to express (a) the second personal
pronoun; (b) the relative pronoun; (c) the
reflexive pronoun. The third pronominal element,
denoting distance, is used to express (a) the
third personal pronoun; (b) negation; (c) separation.”<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
Thus, then, we find that even so metaphysical
a conception as that of individuality is
only expressed by an elementary word implying
locality.</p>

<p>We see, therefore, that M. Cousin is mistaken
in supposing that the pronouns at any rate
were non-sensational in their origin, arising as
they do from the very earliest and simplest of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
sensations. And it is, perhaps, still more surprising
to find that a similar origin can be traced even
in the numerals, which involved the very triumph
of abstraction; for, in using a numeral, “we strip
things of all their sensible properties,<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and consider
them as merely relations of number, as
members of a series, as perfectly general relations
of place.” And yet abstract as they are,
and, absolutely as we might suppose them to be
removed from concrete objects of sense, it is a
matter of certainty that their genesis can be traced.
About the general result few philologists have
any doubt, however much they may differ in their
details. “I do<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> not think,” says M. Bopp,
“<em>that any language whatever has produced special
original words for the particular designation of
such compacted and peculiar ideas as three, four,
five</em>, &amp;c.” Accordingly it has been proved that
the three first numerals in Sanskrit and Greek
are connected with the three personal pronouns,
and originally implied <em>here</em>,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> <em>near to the here</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<em>there</em>; that the <em>fourth</em><a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> implies 1 + 3; that the
fifth, as might have been expected, is connected
with the same root as the word “hand;” that
the tenth numeral means two hands, and so
forth.</p>

<p>Still it might be supposed that the verb
“to be,” predicating as it does the quality of
existence, a conception so abstract that the profoundest
metaphysicians and physiologists have
been as yet wholly unable to find for it any
tolerable definition, would resist all attempts at
a reduction to any sensational root. If we are to
look to a definition of “life” as being either undiscoverable,
or else a discovery which can only be
expected from the ultimate triumphs of science,
surely we might suppose that here at least it is
impossible to find a sensible idea as the root of
the sublime verbs which are the means of representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
life as an attribute. But we are all liable
to the error of forming far too<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> high an estimate
of the intrinsic vitality (the supposed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occulta vis</i>)
of verbs in general. They contain no inherent
powers which separate them from nouns, and
their supposed distinctive character arises entirely
out of their combination with a subject.
The fancy (for instance) that “the root <em>can</em> ‘sing’
differs from <em>can</em> ‘song’ in the same degree that
a magnetised steel bar differs from an ordinary
one, or a charged Leyden jar from a discharged
one,” is proved by minute analysis to be totally
groundless. And the importance of the verb
“to be” in particular has been greatly exaggerated,
as though it were a necessary ingredient
of every logical proposition. For in many languages
the verb is wanting altogether, and its
mere <em>implication</em> is quite sufficient for all logical
purposes. “The verb-substantive,” observes
Mr. Garnett (from whose most valuable Essay on
the nature and analysis of the verb we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
borrowed these suggestions), “if considered as
necessary to vivify all connected speech and bind
together the terms of every logical proposition,
is much upon a footing with the phlogiston of
the chemists of the last generation, regarded as a
necessary pabulum of combustion&mdash;that is to say,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vox et præterea nihil</i>.”</p>

<p>Whatever our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> estimate of the power
of the verb-substantive may be, its origin is
traced by philology to very humble and material
sources. The Hebrew verbs <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">הָוָה</span> (houa), or
<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">הָיָה</span> (haia), may very probably be derived from
an onomatopœia of respiration. The verb <em>kama</em>,
which has the same sense, means primitively “to
stand out,” and the verb <em>koum</em>,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> to stand, passes
into the sense of “being.” In Sanskrit, <i>as-mi</i>
(from which all the verbs-substantive in the Indo-European
languages are derived, as εἰμὶ, <i>sum</i>,
am; Zend, <i>ahmi</i>; Lithuanic, <i>esmi</i>; Icelandic,
<i>em</i>, &amp;c.), is, properly speaking, no verbal root,
but “a formation on the demonstrative pronoun
<em>sa</em>, the idea meant to be conveyed being simply
that of local presence.” And of the two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
roots used for the same purpose, viz. <em>bhu</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φύω</span>,
<em>fui</em>, &amp;c.), and <em>sthâ</em> (<em>stare</em>, &amp;c.),<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> the first is probably
an imitation of breathing, and the second
notoriously a physical verb, meaning “to stand
up.” May we not, then, ask with Bunsen, “What
is ‘<em>to be</em>’ in all languages but the spiritualisation
of <em>walking</em> or <em>standing</em> or <em>eating</em>?”</p>

<p>Perhaps if we were to try to think of any
<em>positive</em> word which it would be <em>impossible</em> to
derive from a root imitative of sound, it would be
the word <em>silence</em>. And yet we believe that the
root of even this word is a simple onomatopœia,
and that it is connected with the sibilants (hush!
whish! &amp;c.), by which we endeavour to call
attention to the fact that we desire to listen
intently. It may help us to accept this etymology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
if we observe that the colloquialism “to be
<em>mum</em>” undoubtedly arises<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> from an imitation of
the sound by which we express the closing of the
lips.</p>

<p>If we fully allow that a considerable number of
roots <em>have</em> (and <em>must</em> have) sprung from the instinctive
principle which we have been endeavouring
to illustrate, we have gone very far to
show what was the origin of language. For the
permutations and combinations of which a very
few roots<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> are capable, and the rich variety of
applications of which each separate root admits,
are almost inconceivable to any who have not,
by a study of the subject, rendered themselves
familiar with the processes of the human mind.
Indeed, a superfluity of roots argues a feebleness
of conception, and a superabundant vocabulary is
an impediment to thought. In the Society Isles
they have one word for the tail of a dog, another
for the tail of a bird, and a third for the tail of a
sheep, and yet for “tail” itself,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>&mdash;“tail” in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
abstract, they have no word whatever. Again,
the Mohicans have words for wood-cutting, cutting
the head, the arm, &amp;c., and yet no verb
meaning simply to cut. But all the specific words
are comparatively of very little use; in point of
fact they are encumbrances, rather than treasures.
It is the sign of an advancing language to modify
or throw away these superfluities of special
terms. Thus the number of roots decreases continually;
in Sanskrit, there are<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> 2,000; in Gothic,
not more than 600; while 250 are said to be
sufficient to supply the modern German with its
80,000 words.</p>

<p>The processes by which this retrenchment is
carried on are the derivation, and composition of
necessary and existing uses to supersede the continual
invention of new ones. The laws by which
these processes are effected are for the most part
regular and universal, and the discovery of them
constitutes the great reward of modern philology.
But as our present inquiries are only of the most
general and preliminary nature, we must confine
ourselves here to giving one or two short and comparatively
easy specimens of what we may term
the elasticity or diffusiveness of roots.</p>

<p>We have already alluded to the root “ach,” as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
having been in all probability an onomatopœian
which gives rise to a large number of cognate
words in the Indo-European languages. It is at
any rate interesting to observe how this root,
however originated, suffices to express alike material
sharpness, bodily sensations, and mental
emotions. M. Garnett<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> gives the following brief
list of examples:&mdash;“<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄκω, ἄκανθα, ἀχὶς, αἰχμὴ</span>, <i>acuo</i>,
<i>acus</i>, <i>acies</i>; Teutonic, <i>ekke</i> (edge), <i>ackes</i> (axe);
Icelandic, <i>eggia</i>, to sharpen, to exhort, to <i>egg</i> on;
German, <i>ecke</i>, a corner; Bavarian, <i>igeln</i>, <i>prurire</i>
(German, <i>jucken</i>; Scotch, <i>yeuk</i>; English, <i>itch</i>)&mdash;<i>acken</i>
(to ache), <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄχος</span> (grief); Anglo-Saxon,
<i>ege</i>, fear&mdash;<i>egeslich</i>, horrible; Icelandic, <i>ecki</i>, sorrow;
German, <i>ekel</i>, disgust; with very many
more. It is possible that Anglo-Saxon <em>ege</em>, an
eye, may be of the same family. Compare the
Latin phrase, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acies oculorum</i>.”</p>

<p>Or, again, let us take the Sanskrit root <em>dhu</em>, to
move about, to agitate. A list of the derivatives
from this root in various Indo-European languages
would fill several pages, but we will only
supply one or two. First, then, we get the verbs
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύω</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύνω</span>, to rush, or move violently, with
their derivatives, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύελλα</span>, a storm; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύννος</span>, a
thunny-fish (from its rapid, darting motion);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύσανος</span>, a waving, fluttering tassel; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυιὰς</span>, a bacchanal;
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύρσος</span>, the shaken thyrsus, or ivy-wreathed
wand, the symbol of Bacchic frenzy;
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θορεῖν</span>, to leap; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θοῦρος</span>, impetuous; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀθύρω</span>, to play;
and among many others, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυμὸς</span>, the mind, from
the same property which struck the poet, in
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">How swift is the glance of the mind!</p>
<p class="verse2">Compared with the speed of its flight</p>
<p class="verse0">E’en the tempest itself lags behind,</p>
<p class="verse2">And the swift-speeding arrows of light!</p>
</div></div>

<p>From the same root we get <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύω</span>, to sacrifice,
from the striking aspect of the rising and curling
fumes, when the victim lay burning on the altar;
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύμος</span>, thyme, from the use made of that herb in
fumigations; <em>fumus</em>, smoke; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυμέλη</span>, the altar in the
centre of the orchestra; and many more. Lastly,
we may mention the curious word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θοάζειν</span>, which
is used in the apparently contradictory senses of
“to move hastily,” and “to sit.”<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>The curious phenomenon presented by the
latter word, of the same root serving for two directly
opposite meanings, is one worthy of the
greatest attention; and we believe that it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
first been definitely noticed by modern philologists.
“Contrast,” says Archdeacon Hare, “is a kind
of relation;” and the suggestion of contrarieties
may even be regarded as a primary law of the
association of ideas. It is this principle which
accounts for the apparently strange fact that
opposite conditions are expressed by the same
root slightly modified. Thus, to select some of
the instances collected by Dr. Donaldson,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> our
own word “dear” has the two meanings of
“prized,” because you have it, and “expensive,”
because you want it; and “fast” has the opposite
senses of “fixed” and “rapid.” Similarly, χρεία
in Greek means both “use” and “need”;
and λάω means both “to wish” and “to take;”
while <em>aio</em>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐδάω</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλέω</span>, “I speak,” or
“call,” are singularly like ἀΐω, <em>audio</em>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλύω</span>,
“I hear.”<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Another instance of the same peculiarity arises
from the different objective or subjective relations
which any phenomenon may present, some
of which relations may be strongly contrasted;
<em>e.g.</em>, a “key” might derive its name either from
opening or shutting. Thus, to adopt some of
the cases mentioned by Mr. Garnett,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> the numeral
<em>one</em> gives rise to compounds of apparently opposite
signification. From the Irish <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">aon</i>, “one,”
we have <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">aonach</i>, “a waste,” and also “an assembly;”
<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">aontugadh</i>, celibacy, and <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">aontumadh</i>, marriage.
The Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unicus</i> implies singularity,
but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unitas</i> implies association. “The concord
of this discord is easily found, if we consider that
the term <em>one</em> may either refer to <em>one</em> as an <em>individual</em>,
or in the sense of an <em>aggregate</em>.” Similarly,
it is not difficult to explain the apparent
anomaly that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σχόλη</span> means both “school” and
“leisure,” and that “lee” has very different
acceptations in lee-<em>side</em> and lee-<em>shore</em>. Other
examples might easily be found, all tending to
prove that “as rays of light may be reflected
and refracted in all possible ways from their
primary direction, so the meaning of a word may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
be deflected from its original bearing in a variety
of manners; and consequently we cannot well
reach the primitive force of the term unless we
know the precise gradations through which it
has gone.”</p>

<p>It has been proved, then, in this chapter, that
a few onomatopœic roots would give a sufficient
basis on which to rear the largest superstructure
of language, and we have shown how in some
cases an imitative origin may be discovered even
in words which might have been expected to
defy analysis. Into the methods adopted in this
rich variety of applications we must inquire more
closely in the following chapter, but we must
here remark that, as it was by the association of
ideas that even the most heterogeneous and contrary
relations were expressed by the same root,
so the words themselves tend powerfully to establish
new points of association, and to facilitate
the astonishing rapidity of thought. By the aid
of verbal signs we exercise an enormous power
over all our faculties, for in repeating the sign
we are enabled by the personal activity of our
will to recall the image which it represents, and
submit that image to our control.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Our sensations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
transformed into thought, come and go at
our bidding, and we extend and multiply them
without limit.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Awake but one, and lo, what myriads rise!</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">By virtue of an active imagination the fathers
of the human race produced the mighty heritage
of speech, and made the utterance of their lips
a means of recalling their sensations and expressing
their thoughts; in <em>consequence</em> of the
activity of the imagination, our words become
the tyrants of our convictions, and our phrases
“often repeated, ossify the very organs of intelligence.”</p>

<p>Hence the blood of nations has often ere now
been shed from an inability to see the synthesis
of various truths in some single threadbare
shibboleth of party; and a mistaken theory
embalmed in a<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> widely-received word has retarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
for centuries the progress of knowledge.
For, as Bacon wisely says, “Men believe that
their reason is lord over their words, but it
happens, too, that words exercise a reciprocal
and reactionary power over the intellect,” and
that “words, as a Tartar’s bow, do shoot back
upon the understanding of the wisest, and
mightily entangle and pervert the judgment.”</p>

<p>There is one moral application of the truths
we have been considering, which we should do
well not to omit; it is the far-reaching danger
of idle<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> or careless words; it is the solemn
admonition&mdash;</p>

<p>If it be impossible for us to <em>know</em> any single
particle of matter in itself; if we are unable to
do more than express the <em>relations</em> of any single
external phenomenon; how can we hope to give
an accurate nomenclature to the <em>noumena</em>, the
inward emotions, the immaterial conceptions, the
abstract entities which we cannot touch or handle,
and which have an existence only for the intellect
and the heart? How can we make the
modulations of the voice the symbols<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> for the
passions of the soul?</p>

<p>In mathematics there is a line, known as the
<em>asymptote</em>, which continually approaches to a
curve, but, being produced for ever, does not cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
it, though the distance between the asymptote
and the curve becomes, in the course of this
approach, less than any assignable quantity.
Language, in relation to thought, must ever be
regarded as an <em>asymptote</em>. They can no more
<em>perfectly</em> coincide than any two particles of matter
can be made absolutely to touch each other.
No power of language enables man to reveal the
features of the mystic Isis, on whose statue was
inscribed: “I am all which hath been, which is,
and shall be, and no mortal hath ever lifted my
veil.” Now, as ever, a curtain of shadow must
hang between&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">No single virtue, no single faculty, no single
spiritual truth, no single metaphysical conception,
can be expressed without the aid of analogy
or metaphor. Metaphor&mdash;the transference of a
word from its usual meaning to an analogous
one&mdash;is the intellectual agent of language, just
as onomatopœia is the mechanical agent. Metaphor
and catachresis (<em>i.e.</em>, the use of the same
word to express two different things which are
supposed to present some analogy to each other,
as when “sweet” is applied to sounds) have
been called the two channels of expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
which irrigate the wide field of human intelligence.
By their means language, though poor
in vocables, was rich in thought, and resembled
in its power the one coin<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> of the Wandering
Jew, which always sufficed for all his needs,
and always took the impress of the sovereign
regnant in the countries through which he
passed.</p>

<p>We might have easily conjectured that such
would be the case. “Man, by the action of all his
faculties, is carried out of himself and towards
the exterior world; the phenomena of the exterior
world are those which strike him first, and
those, therefore, are the ones which receive the
first names, which names are, so to speak, tinted
with the colours of the objects they express. But,
afterwards, when man turns his attention inwards,
he sees distinctly those intellectual phenomena,
of which he had previously had only a confused
perception, and when he wishes to express those
new phenomena of the soul and of thought,
analogy leads him to apply the signs which he is
looking for to the signs which he already possesses;
for analogy is the law of every nascent
or developed language; hence come the metaphors
into which analysis resolves the majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the signs for the most abstract moral
ideas.”<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>To call things which we have never seen before
by the name of that which appears to us
most nearly to resemble them, is a practice of
every-day life. That children at first call all
men “father,” and all women “mother,” is an
observation as old as Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The Romans
gave the name of Lucanian <em>ox</em> to the elephant,
and <em>camelopardus</em> to the giraffe, just as the New
Zealanders are stated to have called “horses”
large <em>dogs</em>. The astonished Caffirs gave the
name of <em>cloud</em> to the first parasol which they had
seen; and similar instances might be adduced
almost indefinitely. They prove that it is an
instinct, if it be not a necessity to borrow for the
unknown the names already used for things
known.</p>

<p>But although we can absolutely trace this process
in so many cases, that we are entitled to
<em>infer</em>, with Locke, that <em>every</em> word expressing
facts which do not fall under the senses, is yet
ultimately derived from sensible ideas, we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
expect to <em>prove</em> this in every particular instance.
When a standard of value is once introduced
among nations, it is almost always a coinage of
the precious metals; but when public credit is
firmly established, a paper currency is allowed
freely to circulate. And so in language many
terms have become purely arbitrary, and in
themselves valueless, which now pass unquestioned
in their conventional meaning, but have
lost all traces of the process to which they owed
their origin, and retain no longer the impress of
the thought which they originally conveyed.</p>

<p>Illustrations are not far to seek; indeed, we
can hardly utter a sentence which will not supply
them, of which the very word “illustration” is
itself an instance. Thus, in Hebrew, the words
for “anger” and “the nose” are identical,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and
even in Greek, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρᾷος τὴν ῥίνα</span>, “gentle in nose,”
is used for “of gentle disposition.” Every
reader of the Bible will recognise that “a melting
of the heart” is the metaphor for despair;
a “loosening of the reins” for fear; a “high
carriage of the head” for pride; “stiffness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
neck” for obstinacy; “thirst” or “pallor” for
fear; a “turning of the face” for favour. It is
this word-painting, this eagerness<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> for graphic
touches, that gives to Hebrew its vivid, picturesque,
impetuous character. It is interesting
to observe how necessary to them it became.
Even when they have by long usage learnt to
accept a special word as the sign of some moral
sentiment or mental emotion, they love to add to
it <em>also</em> a picture of the physical circumstance.
This is the explanation of such apparent pleonasms,
as “he opened his mouth and said,”
“he answered and said,” “he was angry and his
visage fell,” “he was angry and his visage was
enflamed.” It is the result of that vital energy
which enkindled the soul of prophets and poets;
which exalted the intellect of a nation, fully
conscious that it had a mighty mission to perform.
Spontaneous imagery is the characteristic
of all passionate thought.</p>

<p>The Hebrews were not the only nation which
sought for open and confessed metaphors in their
style, when the bright colours of the original
picture-word had grown too dim to recall the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
image which they once presented. We feel instinctively
that certain states of mind can only
be described by a comparison with the natural
appearance which offers the nearest analogy to
them. “A lamb is innocence; a snake is subtle
spite. Flowers express to us the delicate affections.
Light and darkness are our familiar expressions
for knowledge and ignorance. Visible
distance behind and before us is respectively our
image of memory and of hope.”<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Again, to take the first group of English words
which present themselves, what is “imagination”
or “reflection” but the summoning up of a picture
before the inward eye? What is “comprehension”
but a grasping; “disgust” but an unpleasant
taste; “insinuation” but a getting into the
bosom of anything? Courage is “good heart;”
“rectitude” a perpendicular position; “austerity”
is dryness; “superciliousness” a raising of the
eyebrow; “humility” is something cognate to
the ground; “fortune” is the falling of a lot;
“<em>virtue</em>” is that which becomes a <em>man</em>; “humanity”
is the proper characteristic of our race;
“courtesy” is borrowed from palaces; “calamity”
is the hurrying of the wind among the reeds.
What are “aversion”<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and “inclination” but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
turning away from, and a bending towards?
“Error” is a wandering out of the way; “envy”
is looking upon another with an evil eye; an
“emotion” is a movement of the soul; “influence”
recalls the ripple circling on the surface
of a stream; “heaven” is the canopy <em>heaved</em> over
our heads; “hell” is the <em>hollow</em> space beneath our
feet; “religion” is a solemn study, or a binding,
or a new<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> choice; an “angel” is a messenger;
the “spirit” is but a breath of air.</p>

<p>The last etymology reminds us that we can
carry our proofs of what we assert into still
higher regions, even the transcendental regions
of human faith and worship. “Mystery” is
derived from “mu,” the imitation of closing the
lips; “priest” from “presbuteros,” elder; “sacrament”
is deduced from the meaning “oath;”
“baptism” is dipping; “propitiation” is bringing
near; “wisdom” is that which we have seen;
even the word for God himself, in Sanskrit as
in Chinese, means but the bright ether<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> or

<p>To illustrate this necessity of metaphor any
farther would be superfluous, since the materials
for doing so are sufficiently abundant for any
student who wishes to pursue the subject. The
philosophical examination of the thoughts which
are thus involved in concrete images is a most
valuable inquiry, and one which opens a field of
inexhaustible interest. The metaphors which we
are thus forced to adopt are a living memorial<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
of the quick perceptions, the poetic intuitions,
the deep insight of our ancestors: or are else a
perpetuation of their unaccountable caprices of
feeling or fancy, their vulgar errors and groundless
suppositions. It sometimes happens that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in all languages, the same analogy has been
thus seized upon for a transitive “application,”
as in the words <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">רוּחַ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πνεῦμα</span>, <em>anima, spirit</em>, which
all mean ‘wind;’ but, more frequently, different
aspects of the same phenomenon have led to a
different nomenclature; thus, “to think” is in
Hebrew “to <em>speak</em>;” and among the savages of the
Pacific it is “to speak in the stomach;” while
in French it means “to weigh,” and in Greek it is
often described by a word borrowed from the
deep purpling<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> of an agitated sea.</p>

<p>We call an expression metaphoric when it is
applied in such a way that we glide lightly over
its primary and obvious meaning to attach to it
one which is secondary and more indirect. We
call an expression a <em>catachresis</em> when it is used
inappropriately, although custom may have
sanctioned the use of it in the inappropriate
sense; <em>e.g.</em>, when we speak of “an arm of the
sea,” the word “arm” is a catachresis; and when
Shakspeare uses the phrase “To take up arms
against a sea of troubles,” it is only the use of
this figure twice in the same line that forces on
us a sense of incongruity.</p>

<p>Catachresis, as well as metaphor, has given rise
to a large set of terms, phrases, and expressions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and it is in one sense bolder than metaphor, because
it takes words without any modification to
apply them to fresh emergencies. Thus, very
often words applicable to one sense are adopted
to express the sensations of another. That there
is<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> an analogy between the manners in which
they are affected no one will deny. The plant
“heliotrope” recalls by its smell the taste which
has given it its vulgar name; the king of
Hanover knew from the overture to a piece of
music, that the scene of it was supposed to be
a wood; Saunderson, who was born blind, compared
the colour <em>red</em> to the blowing of a trumpet,
or the crowing of a cock. There is, therefore,
no inherent absurdity, though there is much
affectation, in such lines as Ford’s&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p>It is against catachresis rather than against
metaphor that philosophers should have inveighed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
“There is,” says Seneca, “a vast number
of things without names, which we call, not
by proper designations, but by borrowed and
adapted ones. We apply the word ‘foot,’ both
to our own foot and that of a couch, and of a sail,
and of a page, though these things are naturally
distinct. But this results from the poverty of
language.” “It is a ridiculous sterility,” says
Voltaire, “to have been ignorant how to express
otherwise an <em>arm</em> of the sea, an <em>arm</em> of a balance,
an <em>arm</em> of a chair; it is a poverty of intellect
which leads us to speak equally of the <em>head</em> of a
nail, and the <em>head</em> of an army.” It is this very
frequent use of homonyms which leads to such
great uncertainty about the meaning of many
Hebrew words. Catachresis ought to be sparingly
applied, and it possesses none of the advantages
which arise from metaphor.</p>

<p>When the Megarians wanted assistance from
the Spartans, they threw down an empty meal-bag
before the assembly, and declared that “it lacked
meal.” The Laconic criticism “that the mention
of the sack was superfluous,” cannot be considered
a fair one, because the action gave far
more point to the request. When the Scythian
ambassadors wished to prove to Darius the hopelessness
of invading their country, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
making a long harangue, they argued with infinitely
more force by merely bringing him a bird,
a mouse, a frog, and two arrows, to imply, that
unless he could soar like a bird, burrow like a
mouse, and hide in the marshes like a frog, he
would never be able to escape their shafts. The
tall poppyheads that Tarquinius lopped off with
his stick in the presence of the messenger of
Sextus, conveyed more vividly the intended lesson
than any amount of diabolical advice; and
turning<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> to Jewish history, we shall find that
the prophets found it necessary to illustrate
even <em>their</em> language (metaphorical as it was) by
living pictures&mdash;the rending of a garment, the
hiding of a girdle, the pushing with iron horns&mdash;in
order to bring home a vivid sense of conviction
to the gross hearts of the people whom
they taught.</p>

<p>But when such outward illustrations are impossible,
we adopt a shadow of them by painting with
words. When we speak of the cornfields standing
so thick with corn, that they laugh and sing;
when we speak of the harvests thirsting, or of the
green fields sleeping in the quiet sunshine; when
we speak of the thunderbolts of eloquence, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
dewy close of tender music, our language is
understood perhaps with more rapidity, and
our meaning expressed with greater clearness,
than if we were to translate the same phrases
into more prosaic and less imaginative expression.</p>

<p>Even the unimaginative<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>Aristotle observed
the fact. Mere names, he says, carry to the
mind of the hearer their specific meaning, and
there they end; but metaphors do more than
this, for they awaken new thoughts. Let us take
Aristotle’s own example of the word “age,” and
instead of Solomon’s fine expression, “when the
almond-tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper
be a burden,” substitute “when the hair is
white, and the body decrepit;” who does not
see that the force and poetry of the passage is
evaporated at once?</p>

<p>And, in point of fact, we do not go at all nearer
to truth by a substitution of terms that imply no
direct figure. Eloquence, for instance, has in
all ages been compared to thunder<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and lightning,
because the effect of it upon the mind is closely
analogous to that produced by the bursting of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
storm; and when, out of dislike to such expressions,
we talk of eloquence as having been passionate,
or forcible, or effective, the impressions
we convey are not nearly so powerful, or
nearly so descriptive. And in many cases we
must rest content to leave our emotions unexpressed,
if we will not condescend to use the
assistance of figurative terms. “Language,”
says Mr. Carlyle, “is the flesh-garment of
Thought. I said that Imagination wove this flesh-garment;
and does she not? Metaphors are her
stuff. Examine Language. What, if you except
some few primitive elements (of natural sound),
what is it all but metaphors recognised as such,
or no longer recognised; still fluid and florid,
or now solid-grown and colourless? If those
same primitive elements are the osseous fixtures
in the flesh-garment, Language&mdash;then are metaphors
its muscles, and tissues, and living integuments.
An unmetaphorical style you shall in
vain seek for: is not your very <em>attention</em><a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> a
<em>stretching-to</em>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Our minds are simply not adapted to deal
familiarly with the abstract; we yearn for the
concrete, and the successful adoption of it often
constitutes the power and beauty of rhetoric and
poetry. For the attributes of poetry cannot
better be summed up than by saying with Milton,
that it is “simple, <em>sensuous</em>, passionate.” It has
been said, that “good writing and brilliant discourse
are perpetual allegories.” The Bible
more than any other book abounds in this energy
of style, this matchless vivacity of description;
and hence of all books it is the most fresh and
living, the one which speaks most musically to
the ear, most thrillingly to the heart,&mdash;the one
whose rich bloom of eloquence is least dimmed
by being transfused into other tongues, and the
rapid wings of its words the least broken and
injured by the process of many hundred years.
The idioms of all language approach each other
most nearly in passages of the greatest eloquence
and power: here the syllogism of emotion transcends
the syllogism of logic, and grammatical
formulæ are fused and calcined in the flame of
passion.</p>

<p>This concreteness of style, and liberal use of
simple metaphor, is nowhere so beautifully conspicuous
as in the teaching of our Lord, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
doubtless adopted it for the express purpose
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">They might learn who bind the sheaf,</p>
<p class="verse2">Or crush the grape, or dig the grave,</p>
<p class="verse2">And those wild eyes that watch the wave</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent">“Consider the<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>lilies how they grow; they toil
not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you that
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like
one of these. If, then, God so clothe the grass,
which to-day is in the field, and to-morrow is
cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe
you, oh ye of little faith!”</p>

<p>“Let us here adopt,” says Dr. Campbell, “a
little of the tasteless manner of modern paraphrasts,
by the substitution of more general
terms, one of their many processes of infrigidating,
and let us observe the effect produced by
this change. ‘Consider the flowers how they
gradually increase in their size; they do no manner
of work, and yet I declare unto you, that no king
whatever, in his most splendid habit, is dressed
up like them. If, then, God in his providence
doth so adorn the vegetable productions which
continue but a little time on the land, and are
afterwards devoted to the meanest uses, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
much more will he provide clothing for you!’
How spiritless<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> is the same sentiment rendered by
these small variations! The very particularising
of to-day and to-morrow is infinitely more expressive
of transitoriness than any description
wherein the terms are general, that can be substituted
in its room.”</p>

<p>Philosophers, then, have been mistaken in complaining
of metaphors as a proof<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> of poverty.
Tropes, it has been said, would disappear, if we
had in every case a direct and independent expression,
and metaphor is a coin struck only for
the earth. How this may be we know not;
although, if there be mysteries even for the
angels, then for them also will the gracious analogies
of a sublime symbolism be no less necessary.
For us at any rate, since it is impossible
to find a direct word for every phenomenon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
metaphor is our only resource; the figure is
necessitated by the non-existence of the proper
term. Because poetry abounds in figures, it does
not follow that it is “the dark murmur of a lie,
instead of the clear cry of truth,” but that it deals
for the most part with thoughts which transcend
the exigencies of ordinary expression. We must
not complain of the lunar beam of genius, because
it has not the brightness of the sun. Our
choice lies between an enchanting and beautiful
twilight, or a darkness which may be felt.</p>

<p>If any one wishes to compare the difference
between metaphorical language and the phraseology
which studiously avoids the use of metaphor,
and clings as far as possible to bare fact, let
him contrast the nomenclature of science with
the parallel nomenclature of the people.</p>

<p>The terminology of science is of necessity
“conventional,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> precise, constant; copious in
words and minute in distinctions, according to
the needs of the science;” but this very necessity
kills the imagination, and leaves an uninviting
argot in the place of warm and glowing
human speech. It is absurd to quarrel with and
ridicule the language of science, since in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
researches an inaccurate or ill-defined name&mdash;a
name that <em>connotes</em> many other things, or in
itself involves an unproven theory&mdash;may be productive
of the most disastrous consequences.
But, at the same time, the mere nomenclature,
in becoming steady and determinate, is too often
uncouth and inharmonious,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and we see that if
the language of common life were equally invariable,
and unelastic, imagination would be
cancelled, and genius crushed. Metaphor is no
longer possible in a language which has the
power of expressing everything. Such “lexical
superfetations” as “chrysanthemum leukanthemum,”
and “platykeros,” may be necessary to
science, but who would exchange them for the
popular names of “Reine Marguerite,” and
“Stagbeetle” (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cerf volant</i>)? And is there not
something almost repulsive in such a term as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
“Myosotis scorpioeides” (scorpion-shaped mouse’s
ear!) when compared with the sweet vulgar names
“Forget-me-not,” “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Yeux de la Sainte Vierge</span>,”
and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Plus je vous vois, plus je vous aime</span>?” The
language of science is only picturesque, when, as
in the case of astronomy, it borrows from shepherd
philosophers such names as the “chariot,”
“the serpent,” “the bear,” and “the milky way.”</p>

<p>Language, then, is a plummet<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> which can never
fathom the abysses of existence; and yet by its
means we can learn more of the world of spirit
than the senses can ever tell us about the visible
and the material. When we speak of any sensible
object, we only adopt a convenient name
for a certain synthesis of properties, and we do
not thereby advance a single step towards the
knowledge of the thing in its abstract essence.
The very existence of substance as an absolute
entity, an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ens per se existens</i>, the postulated
residuum after the abstraction of all<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> separate
qualities which are cognisable by the senses, is
entirely denied by idealists, who would reduce
all outward things to a mere relation, or a
modification of the sentient subject. Nature
itself is with them nothing more than “an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
apocalypse of the mind.” We speak of “gold,”
and we mean thereby an object of which
perhaps our first and main conceptions are that
it is heavy, yellow, and valuable as a medium
of exchange; yet the property which we call
“heavy” is one which we can easily conceive
capable of modification; the property of yellowness
ceases when light no longer falls upon
the metal; and the property of value is one
purely conventional and continually varying.
What, then, have we left except a philosophical
figment&mdash;a something with the properties of
nothing? We cannot assert the existence of
any substance corresponding to the name “gold”
apart from these and other properties, which, as
we have seen, are mere relations. What, then,
do we really learn from language even about the
external world, the world of phenomena and of
fact? When, on the other hand, we speak of
“imagination,” we name one of the noblest
faculties of the intellect, from the analogy
afforded by the property of the glassy wave,
which “refreshes and reflects” the flowers upon
its banks; yet who shall say that our metaphor
(“imagination”) gives us a less clear<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
definable conception than is conveyed by our
general term (“gold”)?</p>

<p>Nothing can be known of itself, but sensible
things can only be named from the manner in
which they affect the senses, and things invisible
can only be pictured forth analogically, from the
manner in which they affect the soul. And God
has given us an intellect capable of observing the
analogies of which the world is full, and not only
of observing them, but of applying to them with
perfect comprehension the words by which we
describe our physical sensations. In the wise
and noble language of the son<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> of Sirach: “<span class="smcap">All
things are double one against another, and
he hath made nothing imperfect.</span>” There <em>is</em>
a close, though mysterious, analogy between
physical and intellectual phenomena. The continual
metaphors by which we compare our
thoughts and emotions to the changes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
outer world&mdash;sadness to a cloudy sky, calm
to the silvery rays of the moonlight, anger to
waves agitated by the wind&mdash;are not, as Schelling
observed, a mere play of the imagination,
but are an expression in two different languages
of the same thought of the Creator, and the one
serves to interpret the other. “Nature is visible
spirit, spirit invisible nature.” It could have
been no result of accident, no working of blind
chance, that made the mind of man a mirror of
the things whereby he is surrounded, and that
created the world of matter under the guidance
of laws which are an exact analogon of the laws
of mind. Thus the Universe itself, with all that
it contains, is a mighty emblem, and man is the
analogist who, by the Word that lighteth him, is
enabled to decipher it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The stars and the mountains, the oceans and
winds, may exist for nobler and sublimer purposes
than “to furnish man with the dictionary
and grammar of his municipal speech,” but for <em>us</em>
at least it should be our first and chief cause of
thankfulness to God when we commemorate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
glories of the world in which he has placed us,
that it is by the reflection of those glories that
we grow conscious of ourselves, exactly as it is
by the reverberation of a luminous ray that
we become aware of the presence of holy
Light.</p>

<p>But, in those primeval ages which saw the
birth of language, the instinctive perception of
this harmony, and the application of the perceived
analogy to the purposes of language, was
far more quick and vivid than it can be now,
when our minds are obscured by discussion,
dried up by logic, and too often choked by the
unnecessary gold of a vocabulary inexhaustible
and ready made. “As we go back in history,”
says Mr. Emerson, “language becomes more
picturesque, until its infancy, when it is all
poetry; or all spiritual facts are represented by
natural symbols.” To the primal man his words
were like the fragments of coloured glass in the
kaleidoscope, readily admitting of a thousand
new uses, “changing their place and their effect
with every emotion which agitated his language,
and lending themselves with a lustre ever-new
to all the new combinations of his thought.”</p>

<p>The dawn of language took place in the bright
infancy, in the joyous boyhood of the world; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
glory-clouds still lingered among the valleys,
upon the hills, and those splendors of creative
power which had smitten asunder the mists that
swathed the primeval chaos had not yet ceased
to quiver in the fresh and radiant air. Everything
was new; the soil was clad in the vernal
luxuriance of green and untrodden herbage, and
a blissful innocence gave to the new child of
Heaven a life of “happy yesterdays and confident
to-morrows.” He looked at all things with the
large open eyes of childish wonderment, and the<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
simplest facts of the eternal Order were to him
miraculous events. To him “the warmth, the
west wind, the ornaments of springtide returned
unforeseen, and the sunrise, was but a long
phenomenon which might in the morning fail the
longings of night. If an arch of resplendent
colours unfolded itself from heaven to earth, and
there broke into a shower of brilliant atoms,
sowing the soil with a dust of precious stones, it
announced a message and a promise of God.
If the moon disappeared in an eclipse, it was
devoured by a black dragon; the thunder was the
wrath of the Almighty, and the manna was his
bread. The adolescent race had all the delicacy
of tact, and all the freshness of sentiment, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in youthful souls identifies itself with the poetry
of things. In fact, life was itself a poesy full of
mystery and full of grace.”</p>

<p>And this delicacy of tact, this youthfulness of
sensation, this ever-fresh capacity for that wonder
which is the parent of all knowledge and all
thought, was allied most closely to religion and to
poetic insight. “They seem to me,” says Plato,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
“to frame a right genealogy, who make Iris the
daughter of Thaumas.”</p>

“In wonder<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> all philosophy began; in wonder it
ends; and admiration fills up the interspace.

<p>To the early language nothing was common or
unclean, as to the youthful nations nothing was
vulgar. With them it was no degradation for a
king to labour in his vineyard and tend his flocks,
or for a princess to join her maidens in washing
the palace-clothes. Homer describes the cooking
of a dish or the cleansing of a chamber with the
same minute circumstantiality, with the same
lively yet dignified delight, with the same sense
that everything human has its own divine side,
as he describes the falling of a hero, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
armour of a god. And the feeling which inspired
him with this catholicity of admiration for every

Then it is that reverence perishes, and
simple acts must be veiled in metaphysical euphuisms,
and simple thoughts overlaid with
galimatias, with tortured acceptations, with uncouth
archaisms. ‘It<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> must always be the same.
After the beautiful period of Spanish literature
come Gongora and his <em>cultorists</em>; after Tasso
and Ariosto, the Chevalier Marin and his pale
cortège of mannered <em>seicentisti</em>, armed with points
and conceits; after Shakspeare, <em>euphuism</em>; after
the admirable French of the sixteenth century,
after the language of Rabelais, of Des Periers,
of Marot, of Henri Estienne, of Amyot, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Montaigne, comes “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">préciosité</span>,”<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> so vain, so
affected, so puerile, so pretentious, so unreal,
so false.’</p>

<p>Thus the language of nations is the type of
their moral as well as of their intellectual character.
As long as men are noble and simple,
their language will be rich in power and truth;
when they fall into corruption and sensuality,
their words will degenerate into the dingy and
miserable counters, which have no intrinsic value,
and only serve as a worthless and conventional
medium of exchange. In the pedantry of Statius,
in the puerility of Martial, in the conceits of
Seneca, in the poets who could go into emulous
raptures on the beauty of a lap-dog, and the
apotheosis of a eunuch’s hair, we read the handwriting
of an empire’s condemnation. Even a
past<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> literature is full of power to save a people
from utter degeneracy. It is the true poet after
all who, more than the financier, more than the
merchant, more than the statesman, more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>

elevates their conduct by purifying their thoughts,
keeps their feet upon the mountain, and turns
their eyes towards the sun.</p>

<p>“It may lead us a little,” says Locke, “towards
the original of all our notions and knowledge,
if we remark how great a dependence our
words have on common sensible ideas; and how
those which are made use of to stand for actions
and notions quite removed from sense, have their
rise from thence, and from obvious sensible ideas
are transferred to more abstruse significations,
and made to stand for ideas that come not under
the cognizance of our senses.”<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>So far we may seem to have been adducing
a crowd of illustrations in support of this statement:
for we have traced the germinal development
of language from the seed and root of
onomatopœia to the various ramifications of
metaphor, and have seen convincing reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
infer the primary origin of all words from
sensible ideas.</p>

<p>Are we then obliged to give in our adherence
to the sensational philosophy, and to believe
that “Nature, even in the naming of things, unawares
suggested to men the originals and principles
of all their knowledge?” Are we forced to
accept the dogma that “there is nothing in the
intellect, which has not previously existed in the
sense?”</p>

<p>Such are the questions which must now be
considered, because these are the conclusions
usually drawn from the premisses, which have
been hitherto receiving our support. The discussion
of them cannot be considered a digression,
because it will lead us at least to recognise the
existence of problems which are of the profoundest
importance, the examination of which
must always bear reference to the facts of language,
and especially to its origin and history.
The space devoted by Locke to the development of
his views on the use and abuse of words is a sufficient
proof that we are not wilfully turning aside
from the direct discussion of the subject before
us. Indeed, it is the assertion of one of Locke’s
acutest<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and most admiring disciples, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
whole of the Essay on the Human Understanding
is “little more than a philosophical account of
the first sort of abbreviations in language.”</p>

<p>Before we reject the conclusion which may
seem to have been involved in the facts which we
have endeavoured to establish, it may be well to
mark the full consequences which the sensationalists
were gradually led to adopt. Locke, in
defining the source of our ideas, had distinctly
acknowledged an <em>internal sense</em>, which he calls
reflection, as being necessary to complement the
work of sensation; in the very passage which we
quoted at the commencement of this chapter, he
goes on to say that we have “no ideas at all, but
what originally came <em>either</em> from sensible objects
without, <em>or what we feel within ourselves from the
inward workings of our own spirits of which we
are conscious to ourselves within</em>.” Similarly,
Bishop Berkeley, in his Theory of Vision, very
clearly lays down “that there are properly no
ideas or passive objects in the mind but what are
derived from sense, <em>but there are, besides these, her
own acts and operations</em>;&mdash;such are notions.”</p>

<p>But of that element of our thoughts which he
called reflexion, Locke, although he barely asserted
its existence, made so little use that it
hardly counteracted the general tendency of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
philosophy. “When<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> a term so wide and vague,
or so complex and multifarious, so thin and
shadowy, or so ponderous and unmanageable,
as this ‘reflexion’ is introduced side by side
with the clear, bodily, definite realities of the
senses (sensation), it can hardly hold its place
securely as a philosophical term.” Accordingly
we are not surprised to find that Locke
was claimed as the founder<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> of a sensationalist
school, whose ultimate conclusions his calm and
pious mind would have indignantly repudiated.</p>

<p>But it was in France that the Essay on
Human Understanding was received with the
most enthusiastic applause; and when the metaphysics
of Locke had once “crossed the channel
on the light and brilliant wings of Voltaire’s imagination,”
sensationalism reigned for a long period
without a rival near the throne. Etienne de
Condillac was the philosopher who was mainly
instrumental in introducing to his countrymen
the speculations of the great English thinker;
and it is an interesting fact that in Condillac’s
first work, “<cite class="fsnormal" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Essai sur l’Origine des Connaissances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Humaines</cite>,” (1746), he had not yet thought
of “simplifying” Locke’s system, by discarding
reflexion as an element of knowledge. But eight
years after, in his “<cite class="fsnormal" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité des Sensations</cite>,” he
states, in the broadest possible manner, that the
senses are the source not only of our knowledge,
but even (monstrous as it may appear) of our
<em>intellectual faculties</em> themselves! And as he
makes the faculty of speech the principle of superiority
of men over animals, he is involved in the
vicious<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> circle of considering language to be, at
the same time and in the same sense, a cause and
an effect of thought. This system found its most
wonderful illustration in the too-famous description
of the statue-man; a being, who, so far from
being capable of acquiring memory, and judgment
and thought, would even be incapable of <em>anything</em>,
except mere organic impressions,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> because
it could have had no will whereby to contrast its
personality with the action of external causes.</p>

<p>So far is it from being true, that there is
nothing in the intellect which has not previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
been in the sense, that even our conception of
matter<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> itself is derived from a superior source,
and would without the intellect be one at which
we could not arrive. The senses themselves can
tell us nothing except in so far as they are “the
scribes<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> of the soul.”</p>

<p>It might have been thought that sensationalism
itself could go no farther than Condillac, but it
found exponents still more audacious in Helvetius
and St. Lambert. According to the former, man
is merely an animal superior to other animals
because of the greater perfection of the organs
with which he has been endowed; according to
the latter, man, when born, is only an organised
sensible mass; and the first objects which strike
our senses give us our first ideas, until thus,
gradually, Nature has created the soul within us.
We are hardly surprised after this to find that
Helvetius considers love to be only the feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
a need, courage to be the fear of death (!), and
“Do what is useful” to be the moral rule; and
that St. Lambert avows openly, that pleasure and
pain are the masters of man, so that the object of
life will be to seek the one, and avoid the other.</p>

<p>Are we obliged by our theory respecting the
origin of language to accept any of these conclusions?
Must we say, with Condillac, that
“science is only a well-constructed language?”
or with M. Destutt de Tracy, that “thought<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> is
sensation?” or (to go back to the cradle of these
materialist imaginings), must we believe, with the
old sophist, that “man<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> is the measure of all
things?” that there is no eternal right or truth?
that justice and turpitude are the result not of
divine instinct, but of association, habit, custom,
convention? Must all morality be founded, with
Occam,<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> on the result of an arbitrary decree? and
must we believe, with Horne Tooke, that truth is
simply and purely relative, since its derivation is
supposed to imply that it is merely what one
“troweth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>To establish such conclusions was the direct
object of Horne Tooke in his “<cite class="fsnormal">Diversions of
Purley</cite>,”<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and it is astonishing that he should have
met with such complete success. A certain Dutchman<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
had preceded him in the same line of
argument; abusing the fact that the terms of
theology, morals, and metaphysics, are originally
derived from material images, he turned theology
and the Christian faith into ridicule in a little
Dutch dictionary, in which he gave to words, not
such definitions as usage demands, but such as
seemed to carry a malignant inference drawn
from the original meaning; and since he had
shown marks of impiety elsewhere, they say
that he was punished for it in the Raspel-Huyss.</p>

<p>Far different was the acceptance given to the
“<cite class="fsnormal">Diversions of Purley</cite>,” which to this day is
praised and quoted, although a recent philologist
has not scrupled to affirm that Tooke’s “alluring<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
speculations will not bear the light of advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
knowledge, and it <em>is hardly too much to say that
there is not a sound etymology in the work</em>.” No
one has done more to overthrow his baseless
fabric than the late Mr. Garnett,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> in an article on
English Lexicography, who has shown in particular
that the details of his much-vaunted analysis
of the particles may be contested more often than
admitted, and indeed that his theory contains very
little that can be safely relied upon. Tooke seems
to have been led to his system by the conjecture
that “if” is equivalent to “gif,” an imperative of
the verb “to give;” but as the cognate forms in
other languages prove that this particle has no
connection whatever either with the verb “to give”
or with any other verb (a fact which was proved by
Dr. Jamieson in his Scottish Dictionary), “any
system founded on this basis is a mere castle in
the air.” “According to Plutarch,” says Mr. Garnett,
“the Delphian EI supported the tripod of
truth; we fear that Tooke’s <em>if imperative</em> led him
into a labyrinth of error.”</p>

<p>Again, let us take the etymology by which
Tooke endeavours to explode the common notion
of truth. He assumes that the word ‘truth’ is
merely a contraction of “troweth,” and that
“trow” simply denotes to <em>think</em> or <em>believe</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The inferences are as follows: “Truth<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> supposes
mankind; for whom and <em>by</em> whom alone
the word is formed, and <em>to</em> whom alone it is
applicable. If no man, then no truth. There
is no such thing as eternal, immutable, everlasting
truth, unless mankind, <em>such as they
are at present</em>, be also eternal, immutable, and
everlasting. Two persons may contradict each
other, and yet both speak truth, for the truth
of one person may be opposite to the truth of
another.” Here we are removed at once from
the solid basis of certainty and conviction to the
shifting deserts and treacherous waves of conjecture
and doubt; and the etymologist would
reduce morality and religion to shadowy superstructures
built upon moving and trembling
sands. Even if the derivation were admissible
we should reject the conclusion, but the etymology
is as erroneous as the inference drawn
from it is dangerous and false. Mr. Garnett, with
infinitely more probability, derives truth “from the
Sanskrit <i>dhru</i>, to be established&mdash;<i>fixum esse</i>;
whence <i>dhruwa</i>, certain, <em>i.e.</em>, <i>established</i>; German,
<i>trauen</i>, to rely, trust; <i>treu</i>, faithful, true; Anglo-Saxon,
<i>treow</i>&mdash;<i>treowth</i> (<i>fides</i>); English, <i>true</i>;
<i>truth</i>. To these we may add Gothic, <i>triggons</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Icelandic, <i>trygge</i>; (<i>fidus</i>, <i>securus</i>, <i>tutus</i>): all from
the same root, and all conveying the same idea of
stability or security. <em>Truth</em>, therefore, neither
means what is <em>thought</em> nor what is <em>said</em>, but that
which is <em>permanent</em>, <em>stable</em>, and is and ought to
be <em>relied upon</em>, because, upon sufficient data, it is
capable of being demonstrated or shown to exist.
If we admit this explanation, Tooke’s assertions
... <em>become</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vox et præterea nihil</i>. In all
inquiries after truth, the question is, not what
people, who may or may not be competent to
form an opinion, <em>think</em> or <em>believe</em>, but what <em>grounds</em>
they have for believing it.”<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>The question how mind can be affected by
matter has in all ages been a problem of philosophy.
Descartes accounted for it by occasional
causes; Leibnitz, by pre-established harmony;
Malebranche, by a vision of all things in God;
Kant, by the existence of innate ideas. However
the question be resolved, it is closely analogous
to the question, ‘how can things immaterial<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
and unsubstantial like thought and conception
be represented, and for all practical purposes
adequately represented by things physical, <em>i.e.</em>,
by pulsations and modifications of the ambient
air?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Idealism denies the existence of an external
world, and obtrudes on us in its stead “a world
of spectres and apparitions;” materialism denies
us the possession of any ideas but those which we
have derived from sense, and thus deprives us of
all belief in an eternal and pre-existing truth;
between the two we lose alike “the starry heaven
above, and the moral law within.” But neither
of these systems can derive any real support from
the phenomena of language, which indeed in no
way affect the considerations they involve. For if
confessedly our words have nothing to tell us, and
<em>can</em> tell us nothing about the world of phenomena,
and yet the common sense of mankind forces us
to believe in the existence of that outer world,
then it can be no argument against the existence
of <em>noumena</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, against the existence of eternal
ideas and necessary truths, that the words
which we apply to our conceptions of immaterial
entities are borrowed from the analogy which
those conceptions offer to the objects surrounding
us in the world of sense. “When we
impose on a phenomenon of the physical order a
moral denomination, we do not thereby spiritualise
matter; and because we assign a physical
denomination to a moral phenomenon, we do not
materialise spirit. Let us not from these appellations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
more or less inexact, draw conclusions
either as to the nature of our ideas or the essence
of things.”<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Even if it were possible that we could invent
names for each separate particle of matter in the
material universe, we should <em>know</em> nothing of any
one particle except that it <em>causes</em> (or, perhaps,
we ought to say no more than that it <em>is</em>) a modification
of ourselves; and yet we believe that
there is a non-ego entirely and wholly independent
of the ego, though it may in no way
<em>resemble</em> our notions respecting it. Why then
may we not equally believe in the independent
absolute existence of ideas which correspond to
our terms,&mdash;truth and justice, goodness and
beauty, space and time?</p>

<p>A shower falls while the sun is shining, and
we are conscious of a sensation which presents to
us an arch shining with the divided perfection of
seven-fold light to which we have given the name
Rainbow. But what does the name teach us
of the thing itself? It is not even a name for the
thing itself, but only for the effect it produces
upon us; indeed for us, the very existence of the
object <em>is</em> its perception, “its <em>esse</em> is <em>percipi</em>.” Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
only is the coloured arch a phenomenon existing
merely for us and our visual sense, but the very
raindrops are only empirical phenomena, and
“their<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> round shape&mdash;<em>nay, even the space in
which they are formed</em>, are nothing in themselves
but a mere modification or principle of our sensuous
intuition; with all this, however, the object
itself remains to us completely unknown.” We
cannot even say that our conception of the object
is in any way like the object itself: can pain, for
instance, resemble the pricking of a pin? Such
language, as Bp. Berkeley showed long ago, is a
mere contradiction in terms; for “an idea can
be like nothing but an idea; a colour or figure
can be like nothing but another colour or figure.
I appeal to any one whether it be sense to
assert that a colour is like something which is
invisible; hard or soft, like something which is
intangible.”</p>

<p>What, then, is the word (<em>e.g.</em> rainbow) to us?
<em>In itself</em> it is worthless, a mere hieroglyphic,
which cannot even teach us one iota about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
phenomenal world. We are very far from agreeing
with the “divers philosophers” mentioned
by Sir Hugh Evans in the Merry Wives<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> of
Windsor, who “hold that the lips is parcel of the
mind.” We still believe that objects <em>do</em> exist in
the external world, even although it be absurd to
say that they <em>resemble</em> our “ideas” of them.
Although to <em>us</em> they can only exist as “ideas,”
and not as objects, we do not therefore deny that
they <em>have</em> a real independent existence of their
own. And precisely in the same way, whatever
may be the derivation of the word truth, and
however much our conceptions of that word must
be modified by the laws of thought, we yet believe,
as firmly as we believe anything, that truth <em>has</em>
an independent, eternal, immutable existence;
that it is infinitely more than a mere “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flatus
vocis</i>;” that its indestructible idea, its original,
its antetype, exists in the Divine<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> mind, and
that if man and the works of man were to sink
for ever into annihilation in the flames of a
fiery surge, truth and wisdom would still exist,
even as they existed when God prepared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
heavens, “from the<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> beginning, or ever the earth
was.”</p>

<p>There is then no reason to complain of the
materialism of language, or to be afraid of the
conclusions which nominalists like Horne Tooke
and his Dutch predecessor would willingly draw
from the origin of words. No system of materialism
will account for grammar, that <em>form</em> of
language which is due to the pure reason. No
treatise on the history of words will be able to
point to any external source as sufficient to
account for the relation<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> of words among themselves.
No language is a <em>mere</em> collection of
words; and Locke in all that he has written
about <em>words</em> has offered no proof that any system
of <em>syntax</em> is ultimately due to sensible ideas.
His followers have attempted this, but they have
failed. An eminent modern scholar has observed
that a “careful<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> dissection of the whole body of
inflected speech will make it plain, that while
words are merely outward symbols, designating
certain notions of the mind, those notions do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
stand related in all cases, just as the words or
inflections which express them, and that we
cannot by means of mere words convert into
physical truth all that is logically and metaphysically
true.”</p>

<p>Language is not what it has been called, “la
pensée<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> devenue matière.” The very expression
involves a contradiction. Words <em>can</em> be nothing
but symbols, and, at the best, very imperfect
ones. To make the symbol in any way a measure
of the thought, is to bring down the infinite
to the measure of the finite. Our words mean
far more than they express, they shadow forth
far more than it is in their power to define.
When two men converse their words are but an
instrument; the speaker is descending from<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
thoughts to words, the listener rising from words
to thoughts. Onomatopœia and metaphor are
sufficient to provide us with the material part of
language, the articulate <em>sounds</em>; but to translate
those sounds into signs or words is the effort of
a faculty which transcends the sense. On the
one hand we have a spiritual perception,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> the
thought; on the other hand a material accident,
the combination of articulate utterances;&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
what power can bridge the abysm between the
two? The reason, and the reason only. Without
reason, the use of metaphor would be
impossible, and the result of imitation would
be a collection of sounds as meaningless as
the screams of a parrot or the chatterings of
an ape.</p>

<p>Surely these considerations are sufficient to
show that there is no danger to true philosophy
in the inferences to which language leads us.
But, indeed, the whole of nominalism rests on a
vast <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">petitio principii</i>. Because our primitive
vocabulary is deduced solely from corporeal or
sensible images, it is assumed, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per saltum</i>, that
our intellect only admits of conceptions directly
derived from the agency of the senses, and that
therefore thought is nothing but sensation. But
the <em>consciousness</em> of the metaphor has vanished
for ages from language, and when we use such a
word as “spirit,” we do not even remember that
our word means in itself no more than “a whisper
of the wind.” Our primitive conceptions admitted
only of <em>expression</em> by means of a material
analogy:&mdash;this is the sole ground of nominalism,
and it will not bear the enormous structure of
inferences built upon it; 1st, that our conceptions
were themselves originally material; and, 2ndly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that they are and must be so still, because we
are incapable of any others.</p>

<p>Finally, there are in every language “a vast
number of words which may be explained by the
idea, although the idea cannot be discovered by
the word, as is the case with whatever belongs
to the mystery of the mind.” Such words are
sacrifice, sacrament, mystery, eternity. The
conclusion to which they lead us is a plain one,
and it is one which will render us fearless of the
arguments which the sensational philosophy has
so long paraded with triumph as the main support
of its unbeliefs. It is that “Words are at
most intellectual symbols, and symbols are, at
the best, words. Neither the words of language,
nor the symbols of religion, are the basis and
reality of thought or of worship; <em>they have no
reality but in reason and conscience</em>, and are of
no use but in so far as they express this reality,
and are so<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> understood and applied.”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE LAWS OF PROGRESS IN LANGUAGE.</span></h2>


<p>The history of almost every language points
to the action of certain general law’s of progress,
which laws are psychological as well as linguistic,
<em>i.e.</em> they correspond and are parallel to the
growth and progress of the human mind. They
may be briefly summed up by saying that languages
advance from exuberance to moderation,
from complexity and confusion to grammatical
regularity, and from synthesis to analysis. The
explanation and illustration of these laws will
occupy the present chapter.</p>

<p>1st. <em>Languages advance from exuberance to
moderation, by eliminating superfluities.</em></p>

<p>The earliest languages are marked by exuberance,<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
indetermination, extreme variety, uncontrolled
liberty. They are melodious, but prolix
and measureless. Words were invented independently,
spontaneously, as they were required
by the tribe or the individual, with little or no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
reference to already existing forms. The absence
of literature, the want of political unity, the
habits of a nomadic life, tended to create an
immense multitude of terms and idioms. Among
semi-barbarous and wandering communities the
peculiarities which we call dialects existed simultaneously
and side by side.</p>

<p>The Caucasus and Abyssinia present us a
number of distinct languages in a narrow district.
The number and variety of the American dialects
is almost as great as that of the several tribes;
and in Oceania it has been asserted that nearly
every island or group of islands possesses a
speech which barely offers any affinity with that
of the neighbouring groups.</p>

<p>Unity of speech is the result of civilisation,
and it is preceded by a diversity of forms which
subsequently become the characteristics of particular
localities. The steps towards unity are
three; first, we have the confused, simultaneous
existence of dialectic varieties; then the isolated
and independent existence of dialects; and,
finally, the fusion of these varieties in a more<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
extended unity. Thus the earliest Hebrew
records contain traces of idioms which were subsequently
the peculiar property of Aramaic, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
we find in the Homeric poems a thousand
variations of form and structure which were
afterwards exclusively Æolic, or Attic, or Doric.
The explanation of this fact is to be found in the
consideration that these forms were in Homer’s
time the common property of the old Ionic
tongue, and it was not till after ages that they
became appropriated and localised. The supposition
that the rhapsodists employed a judicious
selection of idioms, and made a mosaic out of
distinct dialects, has long ago been abandoned
as impossible and absurd.</p>

<p>The process of eliminating superfluities is
found in every language. Redundancy seems to
have been necessary to an early stage of thought,
for we find it not only in words but in expressions.
The whole of Hebrew poetry depends
on a repetition and enforcement of the same
fundamental thought, so as to gain emphasis and
variety. In children we find a tendency to repeat
the same thing twice, once affirmatively and once
negatively, as though the double assertion gave
them an additional security. “It is not you,
but I;” “This letter is not A, but B;” are turns
of expression well known to those who have
observed the language of the nursery. It is
surprising to find the same unnecessary tautology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
existing very widely in the most advanced literatures.
“We have seen with our eyes and heard
with our ears,” is a superfluity which has many
types in the sacred writers; “They were in great
numbers, not in small,” is the translation of a
line in the Œdipus Tyrannus, and we find even
a poet of our own times writing&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent">There is no doubt that such tautologies are often
so far from being barren, that they give force
and precision to the conception which they
convey; but the mischief of them is that they

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two processes by which nations get
rid of words which are mere synonyms of other
words, and are therefore burdensome. The one
is to drop altogether the superfluous word, or
only retain some one form or application of it;
the other is to desynonymise words by using
them each with one special shade of signification.
Thus, when the Greek language obtained the
word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρύσος</span> to mean “gold,” it dropped altogether
the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὔρον</span>, which at one time it must
have possessed, as is clear from a comparison of
the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θήσαυρος</span> with the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurum</i>. What
are called anomalous declensions and conjugations
are explicable in the same manner, since ancient
idioms are always richer than those which have
undergone the revision of grammarians. It is,
in fact, one of the duties of grammarians to make
a choice among the riches of popular language,
and to eliminate all words that are unnecessary.
Thus a boy would be naturally puzzled by being
told that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φέρω, οἴσω, ἤνεγκα</span> are parts of the same
verb, but it will be easy for him to understand
and remember that these words are, in fact, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
débris of three entirely separate conjugations,
parts of which only have been retained, while
the remaining forms have been dropped because
they were in no way needed. Merely capricious
varieties have all been solved into a single
verb.</p>

<p>2ndly. <em>Languages advance from confusion to
regularity, from indetermination to grammar.</em></p>

<p>What is true of the vocabulary of a language
is no less true of its grammar. Here also simplicity
is due to reflection, and is posterior to the
rich complexity of a faculty spontaneously exercised.
Scientific grammar is a subsequent invention;
at their birth languages are lawless and
irregular. The reason why the oldest and least
grammatical languages appear to have the longest
grammars, is because the anomalies are all catalogued
as though they were so many rules, and
what was once permissible because it then violated
no law of language is ranked as the recognised
exception to a definite order. An Isaiah would
have been amazed at reading the innumerable
rules of language by which modern grammarians
suppose him to have been governed; and a
Thucydides would have been hardly less astonished
to see his “syllogism of passion”
rigidly reduced to a syllogism of grammar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>At first, until usage had arisen, every body
seems to have been at liberty to invent or adopt
conjugations and declensions almost at his own
caprice. “The more barbarous a language,” says
Herder, “the greater is the number of its conjugations.”
It has been a fatal mistake of philology
to suppose that simplicity is anterior to complexity:
simplicity is the triumph of science, not
the spontaneous result of intelligence. The
Basque language, which has retained much of
the primitive spirit, has eleven moods; the Caffir
language has upwards of twenty. Agglutination
or Polysynthetism<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> is the name which has been
invented for the complex condition of early
language, when words follow each other in a sort
of idyllic and laissez-aller carelessness, and the
whole sentence, or even the whole discourse, is
conjugated or declined as though it were a single
word, every subordinate clause being inserted in
the main one by a species of <em>incapsulation</em>. This
is the case with the Astec, the languages of the
Pacific, and many other languages. The Mongol
declines an entire firman, and even in Sanskrit,
flexions so far supersede syntax that the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
thought is in some sort declined. In Mexican,
the word<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> <em>Notlazomahiuzteopixcatatzin</em>, with which
they salute the priests, is easily decomposed into
“Venerable priest, whom I honour as my father;”
and in Turkish,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> the single word <em>Sev-ish-dir-il-me-mek</em>
means “not to be brought to love one
another.” Yet even these are entirely surpassed
by some of the dialects of North America. In the<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
Iroquois, for instance, one word of twenty-one
letters expresses this sentence of eighteen words:
“I give some money to those who have arrived,
in order to buy them more clothes with it.” This
one word is an agglomeration of simple words
and roots in a violent state of fusion and
apocope.</p>

<p>3rdly. Analogous in great measure to the law
which we have been mentioning (or perhaps we
may say a further development of the same law),
is the progress of language <em>from Synthesis to
Analysis</em>.</p>

<p>We have seen that many ancient languages are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
polysynthetic or<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> holophrastic, <em>i.e.</em>, that they produce
the entire thought or sentence under the
form of one complex and rich unity, and subordinate
every word and phrase to the domination of
the entire clause. Even in early Greek and
Latin we may find traces of this “<em>holophrasis</em>”
in the separation of two parts of the same word
which was permissible by what is called <em>tmesis</em>,
as for instance in such expressions as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατὰ δάκρυ
χέουσα</span>, and even <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατὰ πίονα μήρι’ ἔκηα</span>. In Latin the
same licence is far more rare, although we find
it in the lines, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inque cruentatus</i>,” &amp;c., and it
was retained in one or two compounds, as “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo te
cumque</i> ferent.” In both languages these extreme
cases early disappeared, and the startling audacity
of Ennius in the famous</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse0"><em>Cere</em> comminuit <em>brum</em>,</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">for “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comminuit cerebrum</span>,” would probably have
made Virgil stare and gasp, as much as<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> the
modern</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse0">O <em>Jo</em> qui terras de cœlo despicis <em>hannes</em>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>But although nothing is left in the Indo-European
languages but the faint <em>traces</em> of that
sylleptical tendency which seems to have marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the earliest stage of language, they offer the most
splendid examples of a perfect synthesis. By a
facile power of composition, and by attaching to
the verb and noun a variety of terminations
capable of distinguishing the nicest modifications
of meaning, they have produced an instrument of
thought almost unrivalled in accuracy and beauty.</p>

<p>In Greek and Latin one word was enough
to express alike the subject, copula, and predicate;
in English, two are always requisite, and
generally three. The single word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τύπτω</span> requires
the three words&mdash;“I am striking”&mdash;to render it;
to translate <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amabor</i> in English or in German we
require four words, “I shall be loved&mdash;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich werde
geliebt werden</i>;” and the same is true of many
other parts of the verb; as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐτετιμήμεθα</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">periisses</i>,
“we had been honoured,” “you would have
perished.”</p>

<p>At first sight this analysis may seem to be a
defect, but, in point of fact, it is a development.
It is a bad thing for the human mind to be
subjected to the despotism of a rigid grammar,
the tyranny of too perfect a form. As it is the
danger of advancing civilisation and of too
refined a society to reduce men to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the deal level'">the dead level</ins>
of uniformity, and subject every caprice of the
individual to the domination of an unwritten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
code, called the “laws of society,” so a language
which crystallises every relation in a definite
form tends to cramp and restrain the genius of
those who use it. In the tragedies of Æschylus
and the odes of Pindar, marvellous as is the
power which crams every rigid phrase with the
fire of a hidden meaning, we yet feel that the
form is cracking under the spirit, or at least
there is a tension injurious to the general effect.
A language which gets rid of its earlier inflections&mdash;English,
for instance, as compared with
Anglo-Saxon&mdash;loses far less than might have
been supposed.</p>

<p>The progress of language from synthesis to
analysis is that of the human intelligence. Later
generations find the language of their ancestors
too learned for their own use. For the unity,
spontaneous but often obscure, of the primitive
tongues, they substitute an idiom clearer and
more explicit by giving a separate existence to
every subject in the sentence. They break up
the conglomerated jewels of old speech to reset
them in an order less dazzling but more distinct.
They sacrifice the magnificence of mystery to the
light of distinct comprehension. Instead of one
sentence, out of whose tangled intricacies flashed,
all the more brightly from contrast, the rays of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
enthusiasm and genius, they attain to a logical
accuracy which gives to each idea and each relation
its isolated expression. What they lose in
euphony, force, and poetic concision, they gain
in the power of marking the nicest shades of
thought; what they lose in<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> elasticity they
gain in strength. If synthetic and agglutinative
languages are the best instruments of imagination,
analysis better serves the purposes of
reflection. Splendid efflorescence is followed by
ripe fruit.</p>

<p>It is thus<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> that Sanskrit, with its eight cases,
six moods, and numerous inflections, capable of
expressing a crowd of secondary ideas, decomposes
first into the Pali (?), Prâkrit, and Kawi,
dialects less rich and learned, but more precise,
which substitute auxiliaries and prepositions for
case and tense; and even these latter, too
complex for ordinary use, are gradually displaced
by the more vulgar dialects of Hindostan,&mdash;the
Hindoo, the Mahrattah, and the Bengali.</p>

<p>In the same way the Zend, Pehlvi, and Pars-i,
are replaced by the modern Persian. The Zend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with its long and complicated words, its want of
prepositions, and its method of supplying the
want by means of cases, represents a language
eminently synthetic. Modern Persian, on the
contrary, is poorer in flexions than almost any
language which exists; it may be said, without
exaggeration, that its whole grammar might be
compressed into a few pages. Modern Greek is
the analysis or decomposition of ancient Greek
during a long period of barbarism. The Romance
languages are Latin submitted to the same
process; Italian, Spanish, French, and Wallachian,
are merely Latin mutilated, deprived of its
flexions, reduced to shortened forms, and supplying
by numerous monosyllables the learned
organisation of the ancient idioms. “The fact
then that the people in Italy, in France, in Spain,
in Greece, on the banks of the Danube and of the
Ganges, have been reduced to the necessity of
treating their ancient languages in precisely the
same manner to accommodate them to their
wants; and the fact that two languages, so distant
in time and space as the Pali and the
Italian for instance, occupy positions exactly
identical in relation to their mother-tongues,
affords the best proof that there is in the progress
of languages a necessary law, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
there is an irresistible tendency which leads idioms
to despoil themselves of an apparel too learned to
clothe a form more simple, more popular, and
more convenient.”<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>In the Semitic languages we find the progress
towards analysis from various<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> causes less decided,
but no less ascertainable. Ancient Hebrew is
remarkable for its agglutination. “Like a child,”
says Herder, “it seeks to say all at once.” It
uses one word where we require five or six. But
as we approach the period of the captivity we find
a propensity to replace grammatical mechanisms
by periphrasis, a propensity still more marked in
modern or Rabbinical Hebrew. The later dialects&mdash;Chaldean,
Samaritan, Syriac&mdash;are longer,
clearer, more analytic. These, in their turn, are
absorbed into Arabic, which pushes still farther
the analysis of grammatical relations. But the
delicate and varied flexions of Arabic are still too
difficult for the rude soldiers of the early Khâlifs;
solecisms multiply, grammatical forms are abandoned,
and for the Arabic of the schools we get the
vulgar Arabic, which is simpler and less elegant,
but in some respects more accurate and distinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the languages of central and eastern
Asia are not entirely wanting in analogous phenomena.
But the facts already adduced are amply
sufficient to prove that, in the history of
languages, Synthesis is primitive, and Analysis,
far from being the natural process of the intelligence,
is only the slow result of its development.
And if it be a natural development it must, on
the whole, be considered an advance.</p>

<p>“An instance,”<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> observes Grimm, “unique but
decisive, is alone sufficient to replace all the proofs
and arguments which I have accumulated in my
reasoning on this subject. Among modern
languages there is not one which has gained more
force and solidity than the English by neglecting
or breaking the ancient rules of sound, and
suffering almost all flexions to drop. The abundance
of medial sounds, the pronunciation of
which may be learnt but cannot be taught, gives
to this language a power of expression, such as
perhaps no human language has ever attained.
Its highly spiritual genius and marvellously
happy development are due to the astonishing
union of the two most noble languages in modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Europe, German and Romance. We know the
part which each of these elements plays in the
English language; one of them is almost entirely
devoted to the representation of sensible ideas,
the other to the expression of intellectual relations.
Yes, the English language, which has
produced and nourished with its milk the greatest
of modern poets, the only one who can be compared
to the classical poets of antiquity (who
does not see that I am speaking of Shakspeare?),
may of good right be called an universal
language, and seems destined, like the English
people itself, to extend its empire farther and
farther in all quarters of the globe.”</p>

<p>To the laws which we have been considering,
many philologists would be inclined to add a
fourth&mdash;viz., the <em>progress to polysyllabism from
a state originally monosyllabic</em>. Many arguments
may undoubtedly be adduced, which give a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ
facie</i> probability to this supposition.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> We will
proceed briefly to state them.</p>

<p>It is argued, firstly, that we should have
expected <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> a predominance of monosyllabic
roots, because it is unlikely that a single powerful
impression would have expressed itself by more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
than one sound. Since one sound would have
been sufficient, we should not be inclined to look
for any superfluity. Impression would provoke
expression with the same rapidity that the flash
of lightning is kindled by the shock of two
electric clouds. It must be remembered that the
young senses of the human race were unaccustomed
to compound articulations, and neither
their ears nor their tongues would have led them
to signify by two sounds or two syllables an impression
essentially single.</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, it is said that existing facts prove
the likelihood of this conclusion. Thus, to this
day, some nations are unable to pronounce compound
consonants by one emission of the voice.
Such is the case with the Mantschou, and the
Chinese can only utter the word <em>Christus</em> by
changing it according to the custom of his language
into <em>ki-li-su-tu-su</em>.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The Chinese then may
be considered as a language petrified in its first
stage of flexionless and ungrammatical monosyllabism.
Thus, in order to express the plural,
they are obliged to add the words, “another”
and “much,” or to repeat the noun twice, expressing
“us” by “me another,” and trees by “tree,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
tree.” The prayer, “Our Father which art in
heaven,” assumes in Chinese<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> the form “Being
heaven me another (= our) Father who,” a style
not unlike the natural language of very young
children.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it is asserted that all existing
languages are capable of being deduced from
monosyllabic roots; that even the triliteral<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
Semitic languages afford abundant evidence of
the fact that the three consonants are only the
result of a growth, since one of the consonants is
often weak and unnecessary, and many of the
words expressing simple<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> ideas have only one
syllable.</p>

<p>Whatever weight may attach to these considerations,
they do not appear to be convincing.
The attempt of Fürst and Delitzch to get over
the fact of Semitic triliteralism is not completely
successful, and no evidence has ever been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
adduced to show the causes which could have
influenced a language to abandon an essentially
monosyllabic character, or the time when so
immense a change could have taken place.</p>

<p>Chinese, as we know, has been monosyllabic
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'rom the earliest'">from the earliest</ins> period, and continues so
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'to h is day'">to this day</ins>; and even Thibetian and Burmese,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
though they have, under the influence of other
languages, made great efforts to attain a grammar,
have yet retained the ineffaceable impress of their
original condition. We therefore reject this
fourth law, as one which, even if possible, is by
no means proven. Further discussion of it will,
indirectly, be involved in the following chapter.
At best, it can only be regarded as an artificial
hypothesis, occasionally convenient for the purposes
of the grammarian, but not corresponding
to any real condition of the languages as once
spoken.</p>

<p>It has been considered by many that language
has passed through four<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> stages. 1. A period in
which words succeed each other in the natural
order of the thought, with nothing except this
order to express their mutual relation, and with
few or no inflections, as in Chinese. 2. A period
of agglutination in which the smaller words to
express relation have assumed an inflectional
form, but without losing the trace of their originally
distinct existence, as in Mongol and the
majority of existing languages. 3. A period of
amalgamation, in which the language becomes
purely inflectional, as in Latin and Greek. 4. A
period of analysis, in which inflections fall off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and get displaced by separate words, auxiliaries,
prepositions, &amp;c., as in English.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>That languages exist in each of these conditions
is undeniable, but that they represent an historical
sequence is an inference which may well
be disputed. The common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> notion that
complexity is a proof of development is, as we
have already seen, entirely erroneous; since the
languages of American savages and central
Africans are surprising in their grammatical richness,
and the bald monosyllabic Chinese is yet
an adequate organ for a developed civilisation.
The logical order is not the same as the historical.
It is the opinion of M. Renan that each
branch of languages was, from the first, pervaded
by one dominant idea, which was due to
the genius of the race by which it was produced,
and that, from this idea, all further changes
directly derive their origin. The entire language
existed implicitly in its primitive stage, just as a
bud contains entire every essential part of the full-grown
flower. Languages once monosyllabic, for
instance, have, he maintains, always continued
so, and although some languages of the trans-Gangetic
peninsula have effected a real progress
in the direction of grammatical polysyllabism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
yet an abyss still separates them from the
languages which are truly grammatical,&mdash;an
abyss which, he thinks, never has been and
never can be bridged over.</p>

<p>But we shall be better able to enter on these
most important considerations when we have
glanced at the <em>certain</em> results respecting the
classification of languages which have been at
present established by modern philology.</p>

<p>Two families of languages, embracing a large
and widely-separated number of the spoken
languages of the globe, have now been distinctly
recognised and clearly defined. These
are the Indo-European, and the Semitic. The
remaining languages, which are non-Semitic and
non-Arian, have been recently included under
the general name Turanian, and the high authority
of Baron Bunsen and Prof. Max Müller
has secured for this name a wide acceptation.
We shall see hereafter that the semblance of
unity in these languages, which is assumed by
the adoption of this name, has been disputed
by some of the ablest philologists, and at any
rate the languages of the so-called Turanian
family have far less real claim to the ties of
mutual relationship than the members of the
Semitic and Indo-European families.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>I. Of these families, the noblest and most
widely spread is the Indo-European, or as it is
now more generally called, the Arian family.
Neither of these names is entirely<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> unobjectionable,
though either of them is preferable to the
term Indo-Germanic, which is now abandoned as
wholly inaccurate. The name Indo-European
marks the geographical extent of these languages,
but it is inconvenient, and not quite wide enough.
The name Arian was given them because the
ancestors of the people who spoke them are
supposed to have called themselves “Arya,”<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
or nobly-born. This name is now generally
adopted, and M. Pictet, one of the profoundest of
modern comparative philologists, has called his
most recent work, “<cite class="fsnormal" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Origines Indo-Européennes
ou les Aryas Primitifs</cite>.” But although this
term Arya is of frequent occurrence in the later
Sanskrit literature, and was also familiar to the
Persians, the traces of it among the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
branches of the race are few and dubious; they
are but very “<em>faint</em><a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> echoes,” if echoes at all, “of
a name which once sounded through the valleys
of the Himâlaya.” Still it is not likely that this
name will now be superseded, as Rask’s term
Japhetic involves an unwarrantable assumption;
and the name Pataric (derived from Patar,
the Sanskrit “<em>pitar</em>,” a father), which has
been recently suggested,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> is not likely to gain
ground.</p>

<p>The Arian family comprises eight divisions,
the Hindu, the Persian, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian,
Sclavonic, Teutonic, and Celtic; of these
it is uncertain whether the Celtic or the Sanskrit
represents the oldest phase, but it is known that
all of them are the daughters of a primeval form
of language which has now ceased to exist, but
which was spoken by a yet-undivided race at a
period when Sanskrit and Greek had, as yet, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
an implicit existence. “It is,” says M. Renan,<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
“the noblest conquest of comparative philology
to have enabled us to cast a bold glance over
this primitive Arian period, when the whole
germ of the world’s civilisation was concentrated
in one straight ray. Just as the Romance dialects
are all derived from a language which was once
spoken by a small tribe on the banks of the
Tiber; so the Indo-European languages presuppose
a language spoken in a very narrow district.
What motive, for instance, could have induced all
Indo-European nations to derive the name of
‘father’ from the root ‘pa’ and the suffix ‘tri’
or ‘tar,’ if this word, in its complete shape, had
not formed part of the vocabulary of the primitive
Arians? What motive, above all, could
have induced them, after their departure, to
derive the name of ‘daughter’ from a notion so
special as that of <em>milking</em><a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> (Sanskrit <em>duhitri</em>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυγάτηρ</span>, dochter, &amp;c.), if this word had not
deduced the reason for its form in the manners
of an ancient pastoral family?” It is
from considerations such as these that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
prove the great fact of the Indo-European
unity,&mdash;the New World now thrown open to
modern scholarship. “That the Sanskrit, the
ancient language of India, the very<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> existence
of which was unknown to the Greeks and
Romans before Alexander, and the sound of
which had never reached a European ear till
the close of the last century, that this language
should be a scion of the same stem,
whose branches overshadow the civilised world
of Europe, no one would have ventured to affirm
before the rise of comparative philology. It was
the generally received opinion that if Greek,
Latin, and German came from the east, they
must be derived from the Hebrew,&mdash;an opinion
for which, at the present day, not a single advocate
could be found,<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> while formerly to disbelieve
it would have been tantamount to heresy. No
authority could have been strong enough to
persuade the Grecian army that their gods and
their hero-ancestors were the same as those of
King Porus, or to convince the English soldier
that the same blood was running in his veins, as
in the veins of the dark Bengalese. And yet
there is not an English jury now-a-days, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
after examining the hoary documents of language,
would reject the claims of a common descent
and a legitimate relationship between Hindu,
Greek, and Teuton. Many words still live in
India and in England that witnessed the first
separation of the northern and southern Arians,
and these are witnesses not to be shaken by any
cross-examination. Though the historian may
shake his head, though the physiologist may
doubt, and the poet scorn the idea, all must
yield before the facts furnished by language.
There was a time when the ancestors of the
Celts, the Germans, the Danes, the Greeks, the
Italians, the Persians, and Hindus, were living
beneath the same roof, separate from the
ancestors of the Semitic and Turanian races.”</p>

<p>Comparative philology enables us to form a
very probable conjecture respecting the cradle of
the Arian race, and even to draw in outline a
picture of their primitive civilisation. We know
that this race was not indigenous in India. M.
Lassen has proved that it entered India from<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> the
north as an aristocratic and conquering nation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
distinguished by its fair complexion from the
swarthier aborigines; and a crowd of linguistic
inferences converge into a proof that it sprang
from the mountain-cradle of Imäus, from which
neighbourhood it seems likely that the Shemites
also derived their origin.</p>

<p>The traditions of the Arians, as well as the facts
of their language, point to Bactriana, as the region
in which they first appeared; central in position,
temperate in climate, rich in the metals always
found in mountainous countries, resembling
Europe in its flora and fauna, and equally
removed from tropical luxuriance and northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
poverty, no other country could be found more
perfectly suited for the peaceable development of
the noble family which was destined to mould the
character of the world.</p>

<p>The Arians did not appear till late in the
world’s history. “The Achæmenid empire, which
is the first great conquering Arian empire, is
contemporary with a period when the descendants
of Ham had already lost all excellence, and
when China had long arrived at that degree of
administrative absorption of which the <em>Tcheou-li</em>
affords an astonishing picture, and which has so
near a resemblance to absolute decrepitude.
Brilliant civilisations, powerful kings, organised
empires, already existed in the world at a
period when our ancestors were still a race of
poor and ignorant peasants. And yet it was
these austere patriarchs who, in the midst of
their chaste and obedient families, thanks to
their pride, their cultivation of right, and their
noble self-respect, laid the foundation of the
future. Their thoughts, their terms, were destined
to become the law of the moral and intellectual
world. They created those eternal words,
which, with many changing shades of meaning,
were destined to become ‘honour,’<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> ‘virtue,’
‘duty.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>In speaking thus of the apparition of a race
or a language, we only mean the time at which
man awoke to reflection and consciousness.
The origin of language is not <em>necessarily</em> identical
(considered scientifically) with the origin
of mankind. The circumstances and conditions
under which man first appeared on the face of
the world is a subject for the research of the
physiologist, rather than the philologist, and it is
more than doubtful whether the most earnest inquiries
will ever be able to draw aside the thick
veil which hides the dawn of human life. In endeavouring
to derive from the facts of language
some conjecture as to the nucleus around which it
grew, and the primitive condition of the races with
whose distinctive genius it is indelibly stamped,
we are not pretending to throw any light on the
original appearance of the fathers of mankind.</p>

<p>II. Second in importance, although earlier
in historical development, stands the great
SEMITIC family of languages. Formerly they
were called by the general name of oriental languages,
and Eichhorn was, we believe, the first to
give them their present designation. The name is,
however, defective, since many people who spoke
Semitic languages (as for instance the Phœnicians)
were descended, according to Gen. x., from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Ham, and several mentioned in that chapter as
descendants of Shem (for instance, the Elamites),
did <em>not</em> speak a Semitic language. But it is now
generally agreed that the sense of this document
is geographical, not ethnographical, and that the
name of Shem is a general term to describe the
central zone of the earth. Were we to name these
languages, on the analogy of the word Indo-European,
from their extreme terms, we must
call them Syro-Arabian. Leibnitz suggested the
name Arabic, but this would be to use an
objectionable synecdoche, and, on the whole, the
term Semitic involves no inconvenient consequences
if it be considered as purely conventional.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>The Semitic languages have been destined to
exercise a stupendous influence over the religious
thought of mankind. Almost unconscious of
science and philosophy, this theocratic race has
devoted itself to the expression of religious
instincts and intuitions,&mdash;in one word, to the
establishment of Monotheism. The three most
widely spread and enduring forms of belief
originated in the bosom of this family. They were
essentially the people of God, and to them belong,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, the psalm, and the proverb, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the prophecy,&mdash;the words of the wise, and their
dark sayings upon the harp. Clear but narrow in
their conceptions, marked by their subjective
character, and capable of understanding unity but
not multiplicity; they lacked alike the lofty
spiritualism of India and Germany, the keen
sense of perfect beauty which was the legacy of
Greece to the new Latin nations, and the profound
yet delicate sensibility which is the dominant
mark of the Celtic peoples. And yet
neither India nor Greece alone could have taught
the world the great lesson which was connected
by the Semitic race with their most imperious
instincts, that there is but one God, and that
religion is something more than a relative
conception. Destitute of that restless spirit of
inquiry which has led the sister-race to explore
every nook of the universe and every secret of
the mind, the highest attainment of Semitic
research is to declare that the increase of knowledge
is the increase of sorrow, and that the
praise and service of God is the sole end and aim
of life. It was a great lesson which the world
could ill have spared, and it more than atoned
for the absence of research, of imagination, of
art, of military organisation, of public spirit, of
political life: it more than atones even for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
egotistic poetry and a defective conception of
morality and duty.</p>

<p>The Semitic languages partake of the characteristics
of that race whose thoughts they
embodied. They are simple and rigid, metallic
rather than fluid; physical and sensuous in their
character, deficient in abstraction, and almost incapable
of metaphysical accuracy. The roots are
triliteral in form and so few in number that their
meanings are generally vague, being in fact a
series of metaphorical applications of some sensible
perception. They are deficient in style and
in perspective; they are, as Ewald observes,
lyric and poetic, rather than oratorical and epic;
they are the best means of showing us the primitive
tendencies of language; they may be compared
to the utterances of a fair and intelligent
infancy retained in a manhood which has not
fulfilled the brilliant promise of its early days.</p>

<p>The Semitic family has three main branches&mdash;viz.,
the Aramaic, divided into two dialects,
Syriac and Chaldee; the Hebrew, with which is
connected the Carthaginian and Phœnician, and
the Arabic. Besides these the Egyptian, the
Babylonian, and the Assyrian and the Berber
dialects are now considered to have a Semitic
character, such at least is the conclusion arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
at by those whose authority is of the highest
importance&mdash;viz., Champollion and Bunsen in
the case of Egyptian, MM. Lassen and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Eugène Bornon'">Eugène
Burnouf</ins>, Dr. Hincks and Sir H. Rawlinson in
the case of Assyrian, and Prof. F. Newman in the
case of the Berber dialects.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> It is admitted, however,
that the people speaking these languages
were the cognate rather than the agnate descendants
of Shem; and it must not be overlooked,
that the conclusion which would rank these
languages as indubitably Semitic is rejected by
philologists so celebrated as MM. Pott, Ewald,
Wenrich, and Renan.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>III. All languages which belong to neither of
these two great families have been classed together
under the name of the <span class="smcap">Turanian</span>, <span class="smcap">Nomadic</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Allophylian</span> family,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> which “comprises all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
languages spoken in Asia or Europe, not included
under the Arian and Semitic families,
with the exception perhaps of the Chinese and
its dialects.”</p>

<p>The chief labourers in the field of Turanian
philology were Rask, Klaproth, Schott, and
Castren; but even M. Müller, one of the
main authorities for the classification of the
various branches of language which occupy
this wide range (<em>e.g.</em>, the Tungusic, Mongolic,
Turkic, Samoiedic, and Finnic), candidly admits
that the characteristic marks of union ascertained
for this immense variety of languages,
“are <em>as yet very vague and general</em>, if compared
with the definite ties of relationship which
severally unite the Semitic and the Arian.” He
argues, however, that this is exactly what we
should have expected, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i>, in the case of
Nomadic languages spoken over an area so vast;
languages which have never been the instruments
of political organisation, which have no history in
the past and no destiny in the future, and which
never had any literature to give fixity to their
acknowledged unsettledness. Though the “Turanian”
languages occupy by far the largest portion
of the earth (viz., all but India, Arabia,
Asia-Minor and Europe), there is not a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
positive principle, except perhaps agglutination,
which can be proved to pervade them all.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible here to examine the arguments
on which the unity of this family has been considered
to be <em>approximately</em> established, while it
is admitted that this unity does not admit of any
proof so strong and decisive as in the case of the
Indo-European and Semitic families. Those who
seek the evidence will find it stated, at full length,
and with great eloquence and ability, by Prof. Max
Müller, in his “<cite class="fsnormal">Survey of Languages</cite>,” and also in
Baron Bunsen’s “<cite class="fsnormal">Outlines</cite>.” Suffice it here to say,
that to many the vast group of Tartaro-Finnic
languages still appear to be purely sporadic, and
to have no common character except such as is
involved in their being neither Arian nor Semitic,
<em>i.e.</em>, in the <em>purely negative trait</em> of an absence of
certain development. Under these circumstances,
we think that for the present it would be far better
to call these languages by the <em>purely negative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
name</em>, Allophylian,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>&mdash;a name which involves no
hypothesis, and which has the advantage of being
the simple assertion of a fact.</p>

<p>But even supposing that we unhesitatingly
admit a postulate so large as that required of us,
by the supposition that the Nomad languages
may be united into one family, which has points
of affinity with the dialects of Africa and America,
and even with Chinese, the further and more
important question still remains; Are there any
points of osculation between the languages of
these three great distinct families? Is there any
evidence in the present state of philology sufficiently
strong to induce a scientific belief in the
primitive unity of human language, and therefore
of the human race? The answer to that question
must be found in the next chapter, and I need
only premise, that it is here treated as a question
of pure science, and is entirely separated from its
theological bearings. The question before us is
not “must we believe in the unity of the human
race?” but “does philology furnish any proofs
or presumptions of the unity of the human race?”</p>

<p>Besides the immense number of languages
now spoken over the surface of the globe, we
must remember that hundreds have now died
away altogether, and left no trace behind them.
Even in our own times, languages are dying out;
the last person who could speak Cornish died
almost within this generation,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and it is probable
that Manx will not long survive, although it may

preserved the articulation of one forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>

of the death of a preceding one.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> “Like a tree,
unobserved through the solitude of a thousand
years, up grows the mighty stem, and the mighty
branches of a magnificent speech. No man saw
the seed planted; no eye noticed the infant
sprouts; no register was kept of the gradual
widening of its girth, or of the growing circumference
of its shade, till the deciduous dialects
of surrounding barbarians dying out, the unexpected
bole stands forth in all its magnitude,
carrying aloft in its foliage, the poetry,
the history, and the philosophy of an heroic
people.”<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Thus the Greeks and Romans<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> displaced by
their dominant idioms numerous languages of
Southern and Central Europe; the Arabs
effaced the indigenous dialects of a large portion
of Western Asia, and Northern and Eastern
Africa; the Spanish and Portuguese have expelled
a crowd of American languages. Again, the
Visigoths and Alani lost in Spain both their
name and their language; the Ostrogoths and
Heruli suffered the same fate in Italy; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
short, we may fairly suppose that the dead languages
of the world are nearly as numerous as
those that are still living.</p>

<p>Passing over the dead languages, is it possible
to deduce even all living languages from one
primitive speech?</p>

<p>Even those who believe in a primitive language
admit that the three families of language are
irreducible, <em>i.e.</em> incapable of being derived from
one another.</p>

<p>“These three systems of grammar (Arian,
Semitic, and Turanian), are,” says Professor
Max Müller, “<em>perfectly distinct, and it is impossible
to derive the grammatical forms of the
one from those of the other</em>, though we cannot
deny that in their radical elements the three
families of human speech may have had a common
source.”</p>

<p>Attempts have, indeed, been made to connect
Hebrew and Sanskrit, but the adduced points of
osculation are so few and dubious, that such
attempts must be pronounced to be egregious
failures. Dr. Prichard endeavoured to prove a
connection between Celtic and Hebrew, but “he
succeeds no better than those who had made
the same attempt before him. In nearly every
case, the identity of the terms compared is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
questionable, and in many it is demonstrably
imaginary.”<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>It must then be allowed, that the Indo-European
and Semitic families are in their grammatical
system (which affords the truest, if not the only
test of affinity) radically distinct, and can in no
way be derived from each other. The motto of
the old school, that “all languages are dialects
of a single one,” must be abandoned for ever.</p>

<p>But even if it could be shown that there is an
affinity between Hebrew and Sanskrit, a far more
difficult task would remain for those who endeavour
to prove from philology the original unity of
the human race; for it would be still necessary
for them to show further the Turanian unity, and
the possibility of a primitive nucleus, not only
for Semitic, and Arian, and Turanian languages,
(assuming this to comprise even the Malay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Australian, Papuan, Kaffir, Esquimaux, &amp;c.),
but also for these languages and the ungrammatical,
unagglutinative, monosyllabic Chinese.
Yet, such is the task undertaken, with vast
learning and marvellous ingenuity, by Professor
Müller and Baron Bunsen. It will, however, be
admitted, that the proved existence of great
irreducible families is a strong <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> evidence
against them. Let us examine some of their
main arguments.</p>

<p>1. “Though in physical ethnology we cannot
derive the Negro from the Malay, or the Malay
from the Negro type, we may look upon each
as a modification of a common and more general
type. The same applies to the types of language.
We cannot derive Sanskrit from Hebrew,
or Hebrew from Sanskrit: but we can well
understand how both may have proceeded from
one common source.”<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Thus it is argued, that although these families
of language cannot, in their present state, have
been derived from each other, yet it is possible
to suppose that they are widely diverging radii
from the same original centre; that they may
all have sprung from a primitive language, whose
existence we may conjecture, just as we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
have conjectured the existence of such a language
as the Latin, to account for the numerous
marks of affinity between the Romance dialects.</p>

<p>But this proposition is hedged in by difficulties.
The very unity of the great Arian and Semitic
families tells powerfully against it. If the
members of these families retain, after the
separation of many hundred years, the most
striking similarity, in the roots of the words
which refer to the relations of life, and to the
primitive acts of weaving and the working of
metals, how is it possible to believe that the
points of resemblance between Sanskrit and
Hebrew, or between Chinese and Greek, are so
extremely few, and so dubiously vague, that they
hardly afford the shadow of a presumption in
favour of the hypothesis which they are adduced
to support? Even if we grant the postulated
length of time&mdash;thousands and thousands of
years&mdash;which take us back to a period when
historical “chronology borders on the geologic
eras,” which will alone render such a diversity of
sister languages <em>possible</em>, we confess that it still
appears to us so improbable, that it rather wears
the appearance of an arbitrary hypothesis, than
an inductive conclusion.</p>

<p>2. The main affinities supposed to exist between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
language of the different families, will be
found at large in the “<cite class="fsnormal">Outlines of the Philosophy
of Universal History</cite>.” Great stress is there laid
(i.) on the supposed discovery of certain non-Sanskritic
elements in Celtic, which form the link by
which the Indo-European family approaches the
Turanian formations; and (ii.) the establishment
of a connection between the Arian and Semitic
families, by a reduction of the Hebrew triliteral
roots to biliteral ones.</p>

<p>(i.) While wishing to allow the fullest weight to
everything which has been adduced by Dr. Meyer
in proof of this discovery, and not professing to
be fully able to weigh the value of the evidence,
we cannot think that his researches have at all
settled the question. Beyond certain accidental
and vague resemblances, a few lexicographical
similarities<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> easily explicable by onomatopœia, and
a few words<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> adopted in consequence of foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
influences, and that general affinity which we
should expect from the ascertained fact of the
psychological unity of the human race, nothing
that we have hitherto met with seems at all
adequate to counterbalance the enormous difficulty
of supposing that families, closely united
together, yet radically distinct from each other,
could, even during thousands of years, have
diverged so widely from a common source.
Again, we must ask, if it was possible for one
primitive language to pass through stages of
development <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'so irreconcileably'">so irreconcilably</ins> different as those
represented by Hebrew and Sanskrit, what cause
can be adduced sufficient to account for the fact
that after the lapse of three millenniums, a Lithuanian
peasant could almost understand the commonest
of Sanskrit verbs?<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The Chinese must always remain a stumbling-block
in the way of all theories respecting a
primitive language. Radical as is the dissimilarity
between Arian and Semitic languages, and
wide as is the abyss between their grammatical
systems, yet they almost appear like sisters when
compared with the Chinese, which has nothing
like the organic principle of grammar at all.
Indeed, so wide is the difference between Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and Sanskrit, that the richness of human intelligence
in the formation of language receives no
more striking illustration than the fact that, as
we have already observed, these languages have
absolutely <em>nothing</em> in common except the end at
which they aim. This end is in both cases the
expression of thought, and it is attained as well
in Chinese as in the grammatical languages,
although the means are wholly different.</p>

<p>(ii.) Very great stress has been laid on the
general lexicographical affinity between Hebrew
and Sanskrit, produced by the reduction of the
Hebrew triliteral roots to biliteral ones. This
was suggested by Klaproth, and supported with
great learning and industry by Fürst and
Delitzsch. We have already alluded to it, and
can only repeat here, that it is not accepted as
certain, or even as probable, by some high
authorities. We cannot now recount the numerous
and weighty objections brought against this
attempt by the historian of the Semitic languages<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>&mdash;objections
derived mainly from the extreme
laxity of the process which even involves the extraordinary
hypothesis, that these triliteral roots
were formed by prefixes and suffixes, and that the
prefixes have nothing determinate about them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
but that every letter in the alphabet might be used
for the purpose,&mdash;an hypothesis contrary to the
most essential principles of language. It will be
sufficient to repeat his questions. How can we
conceive the passage from the monosyllabic to
the triliteral stage? What cause can be assigned
for it? At what epoch did it take place? Was
it due to the multiplication of ideas or the invention
of writing? Was this stage of grammatical
innovation the result of chance, or of a common
agreement? To these inquiries, no answer ever
has been or can be given. The supposition
of an original biliteralism must be considered
(as we said before) simply as a convenient hypothesis,
and must not be taken for an historical
fact.</p>

<p>Languages, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of course, develope'">of course, develop</ins>; but it is, as
we have seen, by the germinal development of a
rudimentary idea, and not by this process of gross
exterior concretion for which no single parallel
can be suggested. The only monosyllabic dialects
which we know, viz., those of Eastern Asia,
have continued monosyllabic for unknown ages.
Chinese cannot attain to a grammar, and the
Semitic languages could never arrive either at
regularly written vowels, or at a satisfactory
system of moods and tenses. Grammar is to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
language its <em>unalterable</em> individuality. The
growth and change of language has nothing
analogous to grammatical revolution; it is due
to a silent, a spontaneous, an unconscious genius,
not to deliberate reflexion, or conscious alteration.
All idioms which have been artificially
altered (<em>e.g.</em> Rabbinic Hebrew), betray the fact
by their harshness and awkwardness,&mdash;their
want of harmony and flexibility; they bear no
resemblance to those languages which are the
genuine instrument of a nation’s thoughts.</p>

<p>3. Undoubtedly the strongest argument in
favour of a Primitive Language arises from the
phenomenon of several languages which appear
to occupy an anomalous position on the frontier
of the great kingdoms of speech, and to present
a lexicographical affinity with one family, and a
grammatical affinity with another family. Such
languages are the Egyptian, the Berber, the
Touareg, and generally the languages of
Northern and Eastern Africa, which resemble
the Semitic tongues, in some parts of their
vocabulary, but differ widely from them in all the
rest. Similarly, the Tibetian and Burmese stand
on the confines of the monosyllabic languages.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only way to account for these
strange appearances is to suppose that language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
had a period of primitive <em>fusibility</em>,<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> during
which they were susceptible of great modification
from contact with other languages also in an
ante-historical and embryonary state. It is
impossible, otherwise, to explain the identity,
for instance, of the pronouns and numerals in
Coptic and the Semitic languages, or to account
for the fact that among different races <em>t</em> is the
sign of the second person singular, and <em>n</em>, of the
first person plural. The analogies which guided
the first men in such cases entirely escape our
power of perception. Philology in its present
state has not sufficient materials to decide how
can it be that a few essential elements in a
vocabulary should be nearly the same in two
languages, while yet they differ totally in so
important a particular as the flexions of the
noun and verb. We know, however, as an
historical fact, that wide as is the difference
between the Semitic and Egyptian systems of
civilisation, and different as are the physical
traits of the two nations, yet that for many ages
the Semitic influence was very strongly felt in
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Egypt, indeed, was only a narrow valley,
surrounded by Semitic Nomads, who lived side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
by side with the sedentary population; sometimes
victorious, sometimes subject,&mdash;always
detested. The Egyptian language belongs then to
a Chamitic family, to which also belong the Berber,
and other indigenous languages of Northern
Africa; a family which is spread in Africa from
the Red Sea to Senegal, and from the Mediterranean
to the Niger.</p>

<p>Of these languages, the Berber presents numerous
grammatical affinities with the Hebrew, but
is completely distinct in its vocabulary. This,
too, may be accounted for by the fact, that it has
also been submitted to long ages of Semitic influence,
in consequence of its relations with Carthaginian
and Arabic. The possibility of a state of
language so incomplete as to admit of these radical
influences from contact with superior idioms, is
an important subject for philological inquiry.</p>

<p>We are forced then to conclude that whatever
may be the other arguments, physiological and
historical, for a material unity of the human race,
a belief, which understood in a high psychological
sense, will meet with universal acceptation, philology
alone, so far as it has yet proceeded, adds
no contribution to the probability of such a view.
Of the primitive men we know little or nothing,
nor can we advance beyond the region of conjecture;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
but language <em>does</em> reveal to us something
about the origin of <em>nations</em>, and the apparition
of the main <em>races</em> of humanity would
appear to have been in the following succession.</p>

<p>‘1st. Inferior races which have no history,
covering the soil since an epoch which must be
determined by geology rather than by history.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
In general, these races have disappeared in those
parts of the world where the great civilised races
have advanced. The Arians and the Semites have
everywhere found the traces of these half-savage
tribes which they exterminate, and which often
survive in their legends as gigantic or magical,
and autochthonous races. The relics of their
primitive humanity are found in those parts of
the world where the great races have not established
themselves, and they present a profound
diversity, varying from the sweet and simple
child of the Antilles to the voluptuous Tahitian,
and the wicked population of Borneo and Assam.
But wherever found, these primitive tribes betray
an absolute incapacity for organisation and progress;
and they wither away before the advance
of civilisation, and pine into a sickness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
decay from which, as far as we can see at
present, not even the healing influences of
Christianity are sufficient to rescue them.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>‘2ndly. The apparition of the first civilised
races; Chinese in Eastern Asia, the Cushites
and Chamites in Western Asia and Africa.
Early civilisations stamped with a materialistic
character; religious and poetic instincts slightly
developed; a feeble sentiment of art, but a refined
sentiment of elegance; a great aptitude for
manual arts and the applied sciences; literatures
exact, but without an ideal; a turn for business,
but an absence of public spirit and political life;
perfect administrations, but little military aptitude;
language monosyllabic and flexionless
(Egyptian, Chinese); hieroglyphic or ideographic
systems of writing. These races have a
history of three or four thousand years before
the Christian era. All the Cushite and Chamite
civilisations have disappeared before the advance
of the Arians and Shemites; but in China this
type of primitive civilisation has survived even
to the present day.</p>

<p>‘3rdly. Apparition of the great noble races,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Arians and Shemites, coming from the Imäus.
These races appeared simultaneously in history,
the Shemites in Armenia, the Arians in Bactriana,
about two thousand years before the Christian
era. Inferior to the Chamites and Cushites in
external civilisation, material works, and the
science of imperial organisation, they infinitely
excel them in vigour, courage, poetic and
religious genius. The Arians far surpass the
Shemites in political and military arts, and in
their intelligence and capacity for rational speculation,
but the Shemites long preserved a religious
superiority, and ended by drawing almost every
Arian nation to their monotheistic conceptions.
In this point of view Islamism crowns the essential
work of the Shemites, which has been to
simplify the human spirit&mdash;to banish polytheism
and those enormous complications in which the
religious thought of the Arians became entangled.
This mission once accomplished, the Shemite race
rapidly declines, and leaves the Arian race to
march alone at the head of the destinies of
mankind.’</p>

<p>Such are some of the conclusions to which
philology would seem to point; but they are
only stated with a perfect readiness to abandon
all present inferences when we are required to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
do so by a wider knowledge, and with a profound
consciousness that what we know as yet is but
a drop compared to the ocean, which is still
untraversed and unknown.</p>

<p>We have seen that philology offers no proof
of a universal primitive language. The question
now arises, Is there any probability of a universal
future language? Does it seem likely that the
day will ever come when all men shall be of one
speech? The noble Indo-Germanic race has
carried its power and its conquests over a vast
surface of the globe, and our own tongue<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>&mdash;which
receives by common consent the meed of
the most powerful of existing languages&mdash;is probably
spoken by at least a hundred millions of
the human race. Have we any reason to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
that English will hereafter prevail over every
other dialect, and become in some form or other
the language of the world?</p>

<p>That the Arian race is the destined inheritor
of the future world seems clear to the least
discriminating glance, because it has proved
itself to be the race most capable of perfectibility,
and therefore most worthy of power. But that
any one language spoken by the various branches
of their race will ultimately prevail to the exclusion
of all others is an event which hardly
seems probable; if probable, it is still in the
present state of the world undesirable; and even
were it certain, yet the permanent existence of
such a language is incompatible with the present
condition of human intelligence.</p>

<p>1. The development of a future universal language
seems improbable. It is true that dialects
become merged in languages, and these languages
lost in others still more extensive, just as streams
flow into rivers, and rivers into the sea. It is
true that diversity of idioms is the characteristic
of barbarism, and unity the slow result of civilisation.
But against these considerations we
must set the extraordinary tenacity of national
associations and national characteristics. However
far we may look into the future, we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
nothing to show us that the distinctions of nations
were not intended to be as permanent as the
oceans that divide them; and nothing to make
us expect that all humankind will be gathered
hereafter (in its present general condition) under
one universal empire, and into one school of
religion and of thought.</p>

<p>2. But even were it probable that there would
be only one language hereafter, such a consummation
would not be desirable, because it would
greatly hinder the search for truth, and would
tend to reduce men to a dead level of uniformity,
a Chinese dryness and mediocrity of intelligence.
It is, indeed, conceivable that a universal growth
of mammon-worship, making merchandise almost
the only occupation of mankind, might tend to
give to languages that form of practical abbreviation
which we find in telegraphic despatches,
and which, to economise phrases and expense,
neglects grammar, and puts down the smallest
possible number of words, with no desire beyond
that of being barely understood.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> But such
abbreviation, useful as it may be for certain
purposes, would, if applied to all the forms of
language, despoil it for ever of all ornament and
all poetic charm, and so far from enabling us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
rival the noble languages of antiquity, would
reduce us to a condition from which the instincts
of our race would inevitably break loose, to begin
a fresh career of discovery and thought.</p>

<p>“Truths,” said Coleridge,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> “of all others the
most awful and interesting are too often considered
so true that they lose all the power of
truth, and lie bed-ridden in the dormitory of the
soul, side by side with <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the most depised'">the most despised</ins> and
exploded errors.” By frequent use, as by repeated
attrition, the brightness and beauty of a
word is worn bare, and it requires a distinct
effort of attention to restore the full significance
to the forms of expression with which we are
most familiar. “Hence it is,” says Mr. Mill,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
“that the traditional maxims of old experience,
though seldom questioned, have often so little
effect on the conduct of life, because their meaning
is never, by most persons, really felt, until
personal experience has brought it home. And
thus, also, it is that so many doctrines of religion,
ethics, and even politics, so full of meaning
and reality to first converts, have manifested
a tendency to degenerate rapidly into lifeless
dogmas, which tendency all the efforts of an
education expressly and skilfully directed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
keeping the meaning alive are barely found sufficient
to counteract.” The weight and importance
of these remarks will best be felt by those who
have observed how new and rare meanings are
perceived when we read the words, for instance,
of Holy Writ in their original language, and
lose sight for a moment of those groundless
fancies with which long association has confused
our perception. To study the Bible in other
languages than our own is like looking upon the
Urim and Thummim when, for him who rightly
consulted it, the fire of the divine messages
flashed upon its oracular and graven gems.</p>

<p>Hence language is most important, is almost
indispensable to the human race for the perpetual
preservation of truths which would otherwise be
banished “to the lumber-room of the memory,”
rather than be prepared for use “in the workshop
of the mind.” For words are constantly
acquiring new shades of meaning in consequence
of the things which they connote, and to such an
extent is this the case, that our quotations of an
author’s actual words often involve a gross
anachronism, because his “pure ideas”<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
often become our “mixed modes.” If, for instance,
we were to use the word “gravitation”
in translating various passages of ancient authors,
we might be led to assert that the great discovery
of Newton had been anticipated by hundreds
of years; and yet we know that those
authors had no conception whatever of the law
which that word recalls to our minds.</p>

<p>Both in the history of the world, and in the
growth of individual intellects, the study of
language has produced the noblest results. To
it more than to any other cause we owe the outburst
of freedom in thought which produced the
Reformation, and the mighty advance of humanity
which followed that emancipation of the intellect
of Europe from the ignorance fostered by a
depressing superstition; and to it in very great
measure we owe the matchless power and beauty
of our own tongue. “Indeed, the adoption of
words from dead languages into English has,

they are at once refined from all alloy of sense
and experience.”</p>

<p>The old Roman poet,<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> proud in the unusual
erudition which had made him master of three
languages, used to declare, that he had three
hearts, and his opinion has been echoed by a
modern poet<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> with emphatic commendation&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="de" xml:lang="de">
<p class="verseq">“Mit jeder Sprache mehr, die Du erlernst, befreist</p>
<p class="verse0">Du einen bis daher in Dir gebundenen Geist,</p>
<p class="verse0">Der jetzo thätig wird mit eigner Deukverbindung,</p>
<p class="verse0">Die aufschliesst unbekannt gewesene Weltempfindung.</p>
<p class="verse0">Ein alter Dichter, der nur dreier Sprachen Gaben</p>

<p class="verse0">Der Geist vereint, der recht wär’ alle Sprachen Meister.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Emperor Charles V. went still further, and
declared that “in proportion<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> to the number of
languages which a man knew, in that proportion
was he more of a man.” There may have been
exaggeration in this expression, but at any rate
it arose from the conviction of an important
truth. And we may add with Göthe the undoubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
certainty, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wer fremde sprache nicht
kennt, weiss nichts von seiner eigenen.</span>” Perhaps
in this sentence we may find the reasons why so
few know their own language in half its richness
and power.</p>

<p>3. A universal language could not, in the present
state of human intelligence, last for any
long period. New circumstances of life, new
discoveries of thought, new conquests of art and
science, would require new forms of expression.
The influences of climate and history would
produce fresh revolutions in the character of
nations, and the change of character would
necessitate modifications of the prevalent idiom,
which in the course of time would diverge so
widely from the parent language, as to be unintelligible
unless separately acquired. There is
in language, as we have seen repeatedly, an
organic life; it is an incessant act of creation,
ever progressing, ever developing. To reduce it
to one stereotyped<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> and universal form would be
to contradict the very law of its being, by substituting
an eternal immobility for that power of
growth and alteration which constitutes its very
existence.</p>

<p>If all men be hereafter of one speech, it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
only be after they have arrived at a condition
when knowledge has superseded the necessity of
inquiry, when intuition supplies the place of
discovery, and certainty has been substituted for
faith. As far as the science of philology can
pronounce an opinion, we must infer, that the
familiar line will remain true henceforth as
heretofore&mdash;</p>

by a Philological student. The list might be very
easily and very considerably enlarged, but any
one who once takes up the study will find in the
books here mentioned ample materials on which
to commence. The questions suggested by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
study of Language are so closely connected with
those of Moral Philosophy, that almost every
philosophical work contains matter valuable to
the Philologist. From Plato, Aristotle, and
Cicero, down to Locke and Leibnitz, there is no
great philosopher who has not in some degree
entered on reasonings respecting the nature and
origin of Language. Perhaps there is no more
important result from the study of Language
than the greater clearness which it necessarily
gives to our metaphysical conceptions, and the
attention which it necessarily turns to the
phenomena of the mind.</p>

Philology has been well defined as the cognitio cogniti, and
Comparative Grammar, (the branch of Philology which occupies
itself with the study of the birth, the development, and the
decadence of various languages, together with their divergences and
affinities), has deserved the title of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θριγκὸς μαθημάτων φιλολογικῶν</span>,

Thus, though Zend and Sanskrit are the oldest languages of the
Indo-European family, they are offsets of an <em>older</em> primitive one.
“Among other evidences of this, may be mentioned the changes
that words had already undergone in Zend and Sanscrit from the
original form they had in the parent tongue; as in the number
‘twenty,’ which being in the Zend ‘<em>visaiti</em>,’ and in Sanscrit
‘<em>vinsaiti</em>,’ shews that they have thrown off the ‘d’ of the original
‘dva,’ two.”&mdash;Sir G. Wilkinson in Rawlinson’s <cite>Herod</cite>. i. p. 280.</p></div>

Bunsen, <cite>Phil. of Un. Hist.</cite> i. 40. The philosophers who
held these views were called “Analogists,” while those who leaned
to the conventional origin of language were styled “Anomalists.”
But Plato and Aristotle admit the existence of both principles, and
have written on the subject with a depth of philosophical insight,
which, in spite of their defective knowledge, has never been surpassed.

The great authority on the ancient views of philology
is Lersch, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sprachphilosophie der Alten</cite>. (Bonn, 1838-1841.)
The question which agitated the schools was, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φύσει τὰ ὀνόματα ἢ
θέσει</span>; it was generally decided in favour of the “Analogists,”
though often for frivolous reasons. See Aul. Gell. <cite>Noct. Att.</cite> x.

<em>mimetic</em> character of words (Arist. <cite>Rhet.</cite> iii. 1, 2), and their
<em>intrinsic</em> connection with things, did not seem to be much disturbed
by the fact of the multiplicity of languages, although this fact led
Aristotle to place the conventional element first. The very word
βάρβαρος implies a lofty contempt for all languages except Greek,
and traces of a similar contempt may be found in the vocabulary
of many nations. Cf. Timtim, Zamzummim, &amp;c., Renan, p. 178.

Dr. Latham points out that this statement requires modification;
e.g., it is doubtful whether a <em>howl</em>, and not a bark, is not
the organic and instinctive sound uttered by dogs. (<cite>Encycl. Brit.</cite>

“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On a très judicieusement remarqué sur celle-ci</span>,” says M.
Nodier, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que la seule induction qui en résultât naturellement,
fort concluante pour la langue primitive et immodifiable des
chèvres ne prouvoit rien en faveur de la première langue de
l’homme; puisque les chèvres formoient elles-mêmes d’une manière
très-distincte les deux articulations dont ces enfants avoient composé
leur étroit vocabulaire.</span>” Sir Gardner Wilkinson discredits
the whole story, and supposes that it originated among the Greek
ciceroni in Egypt, because he thinks that children, unless artificially
instructed, would not have been able to get beyond the
labial sound “be.” (Rawlinson’s <cite>Herodotus</cite>, i. 251.) Surely this
is merely a begging of the question. The fact that the inference
from the experiment was one unfavourable to the national vanity
of the Egyptians, is only one of the reasons which induce us to
credit its reality. Larcher (ad loc.) rightly regards the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ος</span> as merely
the Greek termination.</p></div>

beauty and ingenuity. Neither Epicurus nor Lucretius excluded
altogether the innate element; v. Diog. Laert. x. 75, sq.
Lucretius rightly regards language as no less natural than
gesticulation, and so might have taught a lesson to Reid and
Dugald Stewart. See Fleming’s <cite>Vocab. of Philosophy</cite>, s. v. <cite>Language</cite>.

<p>An extremely curious Esthonian legend (the only one which
Grimm has discovered bearing any resemblance to the Babel-dispersion)
seems to involve the same conception. God, seeing
that population was too crowded, determined to disperse men, by
giving to each nation a distinct tongue. Accordingly, he placed on
the fire a caldron full of water, and made the different races
successively approach, who appropriated respectively the various
sounds of the hissing and singing water.&mdash;Grimm, p. 28. Others

See Wiseman, p. 54. This theory of the development of
human language required the supposition of an indefinite period
of human existence; but even if this be freely admitted, it is
impossible to prove the <em>first step</em> by which unarticulated sounds,
the <em>merely passive</em> echoes of blind instincts or outward phenomena,
could develop into the expression of thought. See Bunsen, ii. 76.
It would have been marvellous indeed, if man had by the mere
possession of vocal cries, not differing from those of animals, been
able to raise himself from the utterances of instinct and appetite to
express the emotions of admiration, hope, and love. See Nodier,

Thus words and phrases repeatedly acquire a conventional
meaning for a generation, and then recur to their old sense.
Almost every sect, every profession, and even every family, have
certain words in use to which they attach a peculiar and special
meaning, which is sometimes unintelligible to others. M. Cousin
has been unable to discover the meaning which the Port-Royalists
attached to the word “machine.” See Charma, p. 209.</p></div>

In the following observations, I quote the thoughts of M.
Renan, pp. 81-83. I have not used inverted commas, because I
have often transposed and abbreviated his actual words. Very
similar are the excellent remarks of Nodier, which are too apposite
to be omitted. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">On ne me soupçonnera pas d’être d’assez

A beautiful illustration of Herder’s will help to show our
meaning. “Observe,” he says, “this tree with its vigorous
trunk, its magnificent crown of verdure, its branches, its foliage,
its flowers, its fruits, raising itself upon its roots as on a throne.
Seized with admiration and astonishment, you exclaim, ‘It is divine,
divine!’ Now observe this little seed; see it hidden in the earth,
then pushing out a feeble germ, covering itself with buds, clothing
itself with leaves; you will again exclaim, ‘It is divine!’ but in
a manner more worthy and more intelligent.”</p></div>

St. Gregory of Nyssa has expressed himself on this subject
with startling freedom of thought. He alludes with ironic pity
to those who speak of the Deity as the fabricator of Adam’s
language, an opinion which he expressly calls a sottish and
ridiculous vanity, quite worthy of the extravagant presumption
of the Jews. And on the subject of Babel, he says, “The confusion
of tongues must be necessarily attributed to the will of
God according to the theologic point of view, but according to the
truth of history it is the work of man.”&mdash;<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contra Eunomium,

By roots we do not mean words used in the primitive
language, but rather “skeletons of articulate sound.” “They are

grounds. “Sepals” was devised by Neckar to express each
division of the calyx (Whewell, <cite>Hist. Ind. Sc.</cite> ii. 535), and yet we
see at once that it is only a very slight alteration of the word
“petals,” and this no doubt was the reason, not only for the
choice of it, but also for the ready currency which it obtained.
The term “Od force” is another instance. Chemistry at one
period affected to give to simple bodies only such names as were
destitute of all significance; but it abandoned this practice in consequence
of the absurdities and impossibilities which it involved.
(v. Renan, p. 148.) Thus, “<em>sulfite</em>” and “<em>sulfate</em>” are due to Guyton
de Morveau. (Charma, p. 66.) “<em>Ellagic</em>” acid is the name given by
M. Braconnot to the substance left in the process of making pyrogallic
acid, and it is derived from Galle read backwards (<cite>Hist. Ind.
Sc.</cite> ii. 547); but such terms are justly reprobated by men of
science. Even proper names, which some have supposed to be
often arbitrary, are in almost every case found capable of a real
etymology. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ils n’ont pas, plus que les autres mots, été imposés

Take, for instance, the word “fal-lals,” borrowed from the
burden of a song, and often used to describe female vanities. Does
not this word afford a curious analogy to the word “falbala,” the
origin of which (to express similar articles) has occupied the
attention of distinguished philosophers? It has been explained as
follows. It is said that a witty prince of the eighteenth century
once entered an elegant shop, and determined to try to the utmost
the assurance of the (probably pretty) milliner. He therefore
asked for a <em>falbala</em>, inventing the oddest vocable he could think
of. With admirable but unconscious insight into the principle
of language, the undisturbed female at once brought him the
garniture de robe called volant, which ended in light floating
points. She instinctively caught the notion involved in flabella,
flammula, &amp;c.&mdash;Nodier, p. 211. The story is told differently by
De Brosses, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Form Méch.</cite> ch. xvi. § 14. The word has excited
much discussion. Leibnitz connects it with <em>fald-plat</em>, and
Hoffman with <em>furbelow</em>. Charma, p. 306. The murderer, Pierre
Rivière, invented the word <em>ennepharer</em> for the torture to which he
used, when a boy, to subject frogs; and the word <em>calibène</em> for the
instrument which he constructed to kill birds. Charma, p. 66.
Du Mérit notices the purely musical names which children
instinctively give to those who inspire them with strongly marked
feelings of love. “Rumpelstiltskin,” the name of the imp in the
fairy tale, is a good instance of the reverse.</p></div>

the causes for the divergencies in sound of obvious onomatopœian
words in various languages: e.g. it is clear that “ding-dong”
could only be used to denote the sound of a bell in a country
possessing large heavy bells, and therefore churches. The sound <em>bil</em>
or bell (Cf. t<em>in</em>t<em>in</em>nab<em>u</em>lum), expressive of a clear sharp tinkle, would
naturally be used by a people, like the Galla, only accustomed
to the small bells sold as trinkets by foreign traders. Among
the Suaheli languages (out of five words given in Krapf’s vocabulary),
no word for a bell at all resembles the sound. I am indebted
to my friend, Mr. Garnett, for these remarks, as well as for other
ingenious suggestions.</p></div>

Nodier, p. 41. Even when the sound is no guide, <em>different</em>
characteristics are chosen by different nations to furnish a name.
The names “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">fledermaus</i>,” “<i>flittermouse</i>,” are suggested like
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chauve souris</i>,” by the structure of the bat; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νυκτερὶς</span> and
<i>vespertilio</i> by its habits; if the differentia of the animal be <em>very</em>
marked, its name will probably be derived from it in all languages,
as <i>noctiluca</i>, glow-worm, <i>luccio</i>lato, ver <i>luisant</i>, &amp;c.; yet even
then not in all, as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Johannis-wurm</i>. Compare again <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σεισιπυγὶς</span>,
<em>motacilla</em>, <em>cutretta</em>, <em>wagtail</em>, with <i>Bachstelze</i>, <i>hoche-queue</i>, &amp;c. If
the bird be rare, it is much more likely to have numerous names,
because the observation of each casual observer as to its chief
attribute is not liable to so much revision. Take as an instance
the night-jar, which is also called fern-owl, churn-owl, goat-sucker,
wheel-bird, dorhawk, &amp;c. See, too, Garnett’s <cite>Essays</cite>, pp. 88, 89.</p></div>

For instance, we find M. A. Vinet (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essais de Philos. Morale</cite>,
p. 323) speaking of the verb as the word which founds, or, so
to speak, creates an ideal world side by side with the real world,
and of which the real world is either the expression or the type.
The word “verb” has often been dwelt on as showing the importance
attached to this part of speech; the German “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zeitwort</i>”
is more to the purpose. The Chinese call it <i>ho-tseu</i>, or the living
word (Silvestre de Sacy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Principes de Gram. Gén.</cite> i. ch. 1.)</p></div>

In point of fact, the conception of existence in untaught minds is
generally concrete, and often grossly material. Vico mentions the
fact, that peasants often say of a sick person “he still eats,” for
“he still lives.” “In the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lingua Franca</span> the more abstract verbs
have disappeared altogether; ‘to be’ is always expressed by ‘to
stand,’ and ‘to have’ by ‘to hold.’</p>

<p>This shows the tendency of language to degradation when not

“It is remarked by a great metaphysician, that abstract ideas
are, in one point of view, the highest and most philosophical of all
our ideas, while in another they are the shallowest and most
meagre. They have the advantage of clearness and definiteness;
they enable us to conceive and, as it were, to span the infinity of
things; they arrange, as it might be in the divisions of a glass,
the many-coloured world of phenomena. And yet they are ‘mere’
abstractions, removed from sense, removed from experience, and
detached from the mind in which they arose. Their perfection
consists, as their very name implies, in their idealism; that is, in
their negative nature.”&mdash;Jowett <cite>on Romans</cite>, &amp;c., ii. 88.</p></div>

Lassen, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Indische Alterthumskunde</cite>. Renan, 219 seqq.
Klaproth builds an argument for the Northern origin of the
Arians on the word “birch,” which bears an analogous name
“not only in the German and Slavonic tongues, but also in the
Sanskrit&mdash;<em>b’hurjja</em>.... It seems birch was the only tree the
invaders recognised, and could name, on the south side of the
Himalaya; all others being new to them. The inference may be
right or wrong&mdash;it is, at all events, ingenious.” Garnett’s <cite>Essays</cite>,
p. 33. See Klaproth, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouv. J. Asiat.</cite> v. 112. Pictet, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Orig. Ind.</cite>
i. 217. The fact that the words for oyster are derived from the
same root in the European languages (Gk. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄστρεον</span>, Ang.-Sax.
<em>ostra</em>, Irish <em>oisridh</em>, Cymr. <em>œstren</em>, Russ. <em>üstersü</em>, French <em>huître</em>,
Germ. <em>Auster</em>, &amp;c.), but <em>not</em> in the Sanskrit or Indian branch of
the Arian family,&mdash;would seem to show that there was a great
separation of Eastern and Western Arians before the family had
reached the shores of the Caspian. A similar fact is observed in
the name for flax, (Gr. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λίνον</span>, Lat. <em>linum</em>, Goth. <em>lein</em>, Ang.-Sax.
<em>lîn</em>, Cym. <em>llin</em>, Russ. <em>lenû</em>, &amp;c.), and shows that the Western
Arians were the first of the family to desert pastoral for agricultural
pursuits. <cite>Id.</cite> pp. 320, 516. Few studies are more interesting
than the “linguistic palæontology,” which thus enables us to
revive the form of an extinct language and civilisation.</p></div>

The name was suggested by Baron Bunsen in 1847. <cite>Outlines</cite>,
i. 64. He even argues for the Turanian character of the Chinese;
“although it is certain that the same opposition exists between the
two as there is between inorganic and organic life.” General laws,
operative in the formation of all languages, ought not to be taken
for indications of special affinity; who would maintain the identity
of quadrupeds and birds from the analogy of their respiratory
and digestive systems? In the formation of languages certain
first principles were necessarily observed by all, and this of course
leads to some general resemblances.</p></div>

“Turanian speech is rather a <em>stage</em> than a <em>form</em> of language;
it seems to be the form into which human discourse, naturally,
and, as it were, spontaneously throws itself.... The principle of
agglutination, as it is called, which is its most marked characteristic,
seems almost a necessary feature of any language in a
constant state of flux and change, absolutely devoid of a literature,
and maintaining itself in existence by means of the scanty conversation
of Nomades.”&mdash;Rawlinson’s <cite>Herodotus</cite>, i. p. 645.</p></div>

It is rather strange that this name, so peculiarly appropriate,
and so much preferable to the other, has not met with wider
acceptation. It was suggested by Dr. Prichard, “the greatest of
English ethnologists.”</p></div>

Garnett’s <cite>Philol. Essays</cite>, p. 85, &amp;c., where the supposed
instances are examined. Most of them are, as might have been
expected, simple onomatopœias of the most obvious kind. See
Renan, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. des Langues Sém.</cite> p. 450 seqq. Nothing requires
more care than an inquiry of this kind;&mdash;often two words
which have identically the same letters have no connection with
each other, while two others derived from a common source have
not one letter in common. As an instance of the former case,
take the French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souris</span> “a smile,” and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souris</span> “a mouse,” (from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subridere</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sorex</i> respectively); as an instance of the latter, take
the word cousin, derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">soror</i> through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consobrinus</i>.</p></div>

A very curious instance of this is the word <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">שווין</span> <em>shoes</em>,
found in a Syro-Chaldaic Lectionarium in the Vatican. We may
here remark that Dr. Young’s celebrated calculation&mdash;that, if eight
words are identical in two languages, the chances of a direct
relation between the languages are 100,000 to one&mdash;is very
exceptionable. See Dr. Latham, in the <cite>Encycl. Brit.</cite> Art. <cite>Language</cite>.
The greatest care is necessary to distinguish between
words really cognate, and accidental isolated resemblances. See

That there is more probability in favour of English becoming
prevalent throughout the globe, than in favour of any other language
acquiring a future universality, is admitted by all who
have studied the subject. See Benloew, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aperçu Général</cite>, p. 92.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
